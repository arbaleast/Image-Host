WEBVTT

00:16.000 --> 00:18.084
If I Didn't Care

00:22.464 --> 00:26.342
If I didn't care

00:27.595 --> 00:31.848
More than words can say

00:32.933 --> 00:37.103
If I didn't care

00:38.314 --> 00:42.317
Would I feel this way?

00:43.485 --> 00:47.531
If this isn't love

00:49.284 --> 00:53.162
Then why do I thrill?

00:54.581 --> 01:00.336
And what makes my head
go round and round

01:00.420 --> 01:05.215
While my heart stands still?

01:05.300 --> 01:08.928
If I didn't care

01:10.305 --> 01:13.849
Would it be the same?

01:15.769 --> 01:21.607
Would my every prayer begin and end

01:21.691 --> 01:24.610
With just your name?

01:26.279 --> 01:29.490
And would I be sure

01:29.574 --> 01:35.454
That this is love beyond compare?

01:37.123 --> 01:39.166
Would all this be true

01:40.585 --> 01:45.674
If I didn't care for you?

02:03.693 --> 02:05.694
Mr. Dufresne,

02:05.778 --> 02:10.031
describe the confrontation you had
with your wife the night she was murdered.

02:14.662 --> 02:16.788
It was very bitter.

02:16.872 --> 02:21.292
She said she was glad I knew,
that she hated all the sneaking around...

02:22.712 --> 02:26.256
And she said she wanted a divorce in Reno.

02:26.340 --> 02:28.174
What was your response?

02:28.259 --> 02:30.218
I told her I would not grant one.

02:30.302 --> 02:33.346
"I'll see you in hell before I see you in Reno."

02:33.431 --> 02:37.100
Those were the words you used, Mr. Dufresne,
according to your neighbors.

02:38.227 --> 02:41.897
If they say so.
I really don't remember. I was upset.

02:43.025 --> 02:46.527
What happened after you argued
with your wife?

02:46.611 --> 02:48.529
She packed a bag.

02:49.614 --> 02:52.783
She packed a bag to go and stay with...
Mr. Quentin.

02:52.868 --> 02:55.161
Glenn Quentin.

02:55.245 --> 02:57.329
Golf pro at the Snowdon Hills Country Club.

02:57.414 --> 03:01.292
The man you discovered was your wife's lover.

03:03.045 --> 03:04.420
Did you follow her?

03:05.672 --> 03:07.840
I went to a few bars first.

03:07.924 --> 03:10.801
Later, I drove to his house to confront them.

03:10.886 --> 03:14.472
They weren't home, so I...parked in the turnout,

03:14.556 --> 03:16.140
and waited.

03:16.224 --> 03:18.434
With what intention?

03:18.518 --> 03:20.311
I'm not sure.

03:20.395 --> 03:22.605
I was confused.

03:22.689 --> 03:24.356
Drunk.

03:26.109 --> 03:29.111
I think...mostly, I wanted to scare them.

03:29.196 --> 03:32.448
When they arrived,
you went up to the house and murdered them.

03:32.532 --> 03:35.618
No. I was sobering up.

03:35.702 --> 03:38.454
I got back in the car,
and I drove home to sleep it off.

03:38.538 --> 03:42.000
Along the way, I stopped,
and I threw my gun into the Royal River.

03:42.085 --> 03:44.294
I feel I've been very clear on this point.

03:44.378 --> 03:48.173
Well, where I get hazy is where the cleaning
woman shows up the following morning

03:48.257 --> 03:53.929
and finds your wife in bed with her lover,
riddled with.38 caliber bullets.

03:54.972 --> 03:59.226
Now, does that strike you as a fantastic
coincidence, Mr. Dufresne, or is it just me?

03:59.310 --> 04:01.144
Yes, it does.

04:01.229 --> 04:07.317
Yet you still maintain that you threw your gun
into the river before the murders took place?

04:07.401 --> 04:11.196
- That's very convenient.
- It's the truth.

04:11.280 --> 04:15.992
The police dragged that river
for three days, and nary a gun was found.

04:16.077 --> 04:18.870
So, there could be no comparison made
between your gun

04:18.955 --> 04:23.125
and the bullets taken from
the bloodstained corpses of the victims.

04:24.418 --> 04:27.295
And that also...

04:27.380 --> 04:29.381
is very convenient.

04:29.465 --> 04:30.966
Isn't it, Mr. Dufresne?

04:32.176 --> 04:34.427
Since I am innocent of this crime, sir,

04:34.512 --> 04:38.099
I find it decidedly inconvenient
that the gun was never found.

04:39.268 --> 04:41.352
If I Didn't Care

04:45.274 --> 04:48.526
And would I be sure that this

04:48.610 --> 04:53.239
Is love beyond compare...

04:56.785 --> 04:59.704
Ladies and gentlemen,
you've heard all the evidence.

04:59.788 --> 05:02.373
We have the accused at the scene of the crime.

05:02.457 --> 05:04.292
We have footprints, tire tracks,

05:04.376 --> 05:08.421
bullets strewn on the ground which bear
his fingerprints, a broken bourbon bottle,

05:08.505 --> 05:10.631
likewise with fingerprints.

05:10.716 --> 05:12.383
And most of all,

05:12.467 --> 05:14.760
we have a beautiful young woman and her lover

05:14.845 --> 05:16.929
lying dead in each other's arms.

05:19.016 --> 05:21.267
They had sinned.

05:22.895 --> 05:26.898
But was their crime so great
as to merit a death sentence?

05:28.066 --> 05:30.151
Now, while you think about that...

05:31.862 --> 05:34.363
..think about this.

05:34.448 --> 05:36.992
A revolver holds six bullets.

05:37.076 --> 05:38.452
Not eight.

05:38.536 --> 05:41.997
I submit that this was not a hot-blooded
crime of passion.

05:42.081 --> 05:45.125
That could be understood, if not condoned.

05:45.210 --> 05:47.836
No. This was revenge...

05:47.921 --> 05:52.424
of a much more brutal
and cold-blooded nature. Consider this.

05:52.508 --> 05:55.052
Four bullets per victim.

05:55.136 --> 05:57.512
Not six shots fired, but eight.

05:57.597 --> 06:01.516
That means that he fired the gun empty,

06:01.601 --> 06:03.894
and then stopped to reload...

06:04.979 --> 06:07.564
..so that he could shoot each of them again.

06:07.649 --> 06:10.234
An extra bullet per lover.

06:10.318 --> 06:12.361
Right in the head.

06:16.407 --> 06:21.328
You strike me as a particularly icy
and remorseless man, Mr. Dufresne.

06:21.412 --> 06:23.664
It chills my blood just to look at you.

06:25.416 --> 06:28.377
By the power vested in me
by the state of Maine,

06:28.461 --> 06:32.005
I hereby order you to serve two life sentences,
back to back.

06:33.091 --> 06:35.718
One for each of your victims. So be it.

07:00.744 --> 07:02.412
Sit.

07:06.458 --> 07:09.377
We see by your file
you've served 20 years of a life sentence.

07:09.461 --> 07:11.045
Yes, sir.

07:11.130 --> 07:13.589
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

07:13.674 --> 07:15.883
Oh, yes, sir. Absolutely, sir.

07:17.511 --> 07:19.470
I mean, I learned my lesson.

07:20.556 --> 07:23.808
I can honestly say...I'm a changed man.

07:27.521 --> 07:29.856
I'm no longer a danger to society.

07:29.940 --> 07:32.026
That's God's honest truth.

08:08.188 --> 08:10.981
Hey, Red. How'd it go?

08:11.066 --> 08:13.692
Same old shit. Different day.

08:13.777 --> 08:17.404
Yeah. I know how you feel.
I'm up for rejection next week.

08:18.573 --> 08:21.158
Yeah, I got rejected last week.

08:21.242 --> 08:22.534
It happens.

08:22.619 --> 08:24.203
Hey, Red. Bump me a deck.

08:24.287 --> 08:27.664
Get the fuck out of my face, will you, man?
You've had five packs already.

08:27.749 --> 08:28.957
- Four.
- Five.

08:30.002 --> 08:33.546
There must be a con like me
in every prison in America.

08:33.631 --> 08:35.548
I'm the guy who can get it for you.

08:35.633 --> 08:38.760
Cigarettes, a bag of reefer - if that's your thing -

08:38.844 --> 08:42.430
a bottle of brandy
to celebrate your kid's high-school graduation.

08:42.515 --> 08:44.849
Damn near anything, within reason.

08:44.934 --> 08:47.227
Yes, sir. I'm a regular Sears and Roebuck.

08:51.565 --> 08:54.943
So, when Andy Dufresne came to me in 1949

08:55.027 --> 08:58.363
and asked me to smuggle Rita Hayworth
into the prison for him,

08:58.447 --> 09:00.532
I told him, "No problem."

09:42.617 --> 09:44.910
Andy came to Shawshank Prison

09:44.995 --> 09:49.123
in early 1947, for murdering his wife
and the fella she was banging.

09:49.207 --> 09:53.502
On the outside he had been vice-president
of a large Portland bank.

09:53.587 --> 09:55.588
Good work for a man as young as he was.

10:00.969 --> 10:02.636
Hey, Red.

10:38.799 --> 10:42.344
Do you speak English, butt steak?
You follow this officer.

10:55.316 --> 10:59.694
I haven't seen such a sorry-looking heap
of m-m-maggot shit in all my life.

10:59.779 --> 11:01.863
Hey, fish! Come over here.

11:16.921 --> 11:19.798
Come on, fish.

11:25.264 --> 11:27.181
Taking bets today, Red?

11:27.266 --> 11:29.267
Smokes or coins? Better's choice.

11:29.351 --> 11:31.143
Smokes. Put me down for two.

11:31.228 --> 11:33.271
All right. Who's your horse?

11:33.355 --> 11:36.649
That little sack of shit...eighth from the front.

11:36.733 --> 11:37.900
He'll be first.

11:37.985 --> 11:40.194
- Bullshit. I'll take that action.
- Me too.

11:40.279 --> 11:42.530
You're out some smokes, son. Let me tell you.

11:42.614 --> 11:44.532
Heywood, you're so smart, you call it.

11:44.616 --> 11:47.118
I'll take...t-t-the chubby fat-ass there.

11:47.202 --> 11:50.580
The fifth one from the front.
Put me down for a quarter deck.

11:50.664 --> 11:53.541
Fresh fish!

11:53.625 --> 11:57.712
Fresh fish today! We're reeling them in!

11:57.796 --> 12:02.049
I must admit, I didn't think much of Andy,
first time I laid eyes on him.

12:02.134 --> 12:05.636
Looked like a stiff breeze would blow him over.

12:05.721 --> 12:08.014
That was my first impression of the man.

12:08.098 --> 12:09.807
What do you say, Red?

12:09.891 --> 12:13.144
That tall drink of water
with the silver spoon up his ass.

12:13.228 --> 12:15.396
That guy? Never happen.

12:15.480 --> 12:16.606
Ten cigarettes.

12:16.690 --> 12:17.857
That's a rich bet.

12:17.941 --> 12:20.151
All right. Who's gonna prove me wrong?

12:20.235 --> 12:22.321
Heywood? Jigger?

12:22.405 --> 12:23.864
Skeet?

12:23.948 --> 12:26.158
Floyd?

12:26.242 --> 12:28.368
Four brave souls.

12:28.453 --> 12:31.288
Return to your cell blocks for evening count.

12:31.372 --> 12:33.874
All prisoners return to your cell blocks.

12:54.979 --> 12:57.064
Turn to the right. Eyes front.

13:10.495 --> 13:13.497
This is Mr. Hadley. He's Captain of the Guards.

13:13.581 --> 13:15.749
I'm Mr. Norton, the Warden.

13:15.833 --> 13:18.335
You are convicted felons.

13:18.419 --> 13:20.755
That's why they've sent you to me.

13:20.839 --> 13:22.465
Rule number one:

13:22.549 --> 13:24.425
No blasphemy.

13:24.510 --> 13:28.054
I'll not have the Lord's name taken in vain
in my prison.

13:28.138 --> 13:29.514
The other rules...

13:29.598 --> 13:31.307
you'll figure out as you go along.

13:31.392 --> 13:33.184
Any questions?

13:33.268 --> 13:34.477
When do we eat?

13:42.986 --> 13:45.154
You eat when we say you eat!

13:45.239 --> 13:48.616
You shit when we say you shit,
and you piss when we say you piss.

13:48.701 --> 13:51.577
You got that, you maggot-dick motherfucker?

13:51.662 --> 13:52.954
Aarghh!

13:53.038 --> 13:54.997
On your feet.

13:55.082 --> 13:56.874
I believe in two things.

13:56.959 --> 13:59.836
Discipline and the Bible.

13:59.920 --> 14:01.754
Here you'll receive both.

14:02.881 --> 14:05.508
Put your trust in the Lord.

14:05.592 --> 14:07.468
Your ass belongs to me.

14:09.555 --> 14:11.639
Welcome to Shawshank.

14:16.770 --> 14:18.188
Unhook 'em.

14:23.445 --> 14:25.320
Turn around.

14:31.745 --> 14:34.079
That's enough.

14:34.164 --> 14:36.915
Move to the end of the cage.

14:37.000 --> 14:38.375
Turn around.

14:38.460 --> 14:39.710
Delouse him.

14:40.920 --> 14:42.796
Turn around.

14:45.383 --> 14:48.552
Move out of the cage, go left.
Pick up your clothes and Bible.

14:48.636 --> 14:50.179
Next man up.

14:52.307 --> 14:55.476
To the right. Right, right, right.

14:55.560 --> 14:57.102
Left, left...

14:57.187 --> 15:01.356
The first night's the toughest.
No doubt about it.

15:01.441 --> 15:04.568
They march you in,
naked as the day you were born,

15:04.652 --> 15:08.739
skin burning and half-blind
from that delousing shit they throw on you.

15:08.823 --> 15:11.784
And when they put you in that cell,

15:11.868 --> 15:14.536
and those bars slam home...

15:14.621 --> 15:17.373
that's when you know it's for real.

15:17.458 --> 15:20.794
Old life blown away in the blink of an eye.

15:20.878 --> 15:22.086
Nothing left,

15:22.171 --> 15:24.881
but all the time in the world to think about it.

15:26.133 --> 15:29.886
Most new fish come close to madness
the first night.

15:29.970 --> 15:33.264
Somebody always breaks down crying.

15:33.349 --> 15:35.809
Happens every time.

15:35.893 --> 15:37.977
The only question is:

15:38.062 --> 15:39.479
Who's it gonna be?

15:40.564 --> 15:43.149
It's as good a thing to bet on as any, I guess.

15:45.069 --> 15:47.153
I had my money on Andy Dufresne.

15:56.789 --> 15:58.414
Lights out!

16:18.937 --> 16:22.022
I remember my first night.

16:22.107 --> 16:24.191
Seems like a long time ago.

16:25.735 --> 16:28.195
Yoo-hoo!

16:28.280 --> 16:30.781
Hey, fish.

16:30.866 --> 16:33.909
Fish, fish, fish, fish, fishy.

16:33.994 --> 16:37.913
- Boy, are you scared of the dark?
- You like it here, new fish?

16:37.998 --> 16:40.332
You'll wish
your daddy never dicked your mommy.

16:40.417 --> 16:44.420
Fishy! Oh, I want me a pork chop. Oh, yes!

16:44.504 --> 16:49.550
You taking this down, new fish?
There's gonna be a quiz later!

16:49.634 --> 16:53.012
- Poke your ass out, give me a first look!
- Shh! Keep it down.

16:53.096 --> 16:56.432
The boys always go fishing
with first-timers.

16:56.516 --> 16:58.559
They don't quit till they reel someone in.

17:01.229 --> 17:03.731
Hey, Fat Ass.

17:03.815 --> 17:05.482
Fat Ass.

17:06.693 --> 17:09.153
Talk to me, boy.

17:09.237 --> 17:11.947
I know you're there. I can hear you breathing.

17:12.032 --> 17:14.951
Don't you listen to these nitwits.
You hear me?

17:15.036 --> 17:17.120
This place ain't so bad.

17:17.204 --> 17:18.830
I tell you what.

17:19.999 --> 17:23.168
I'll introduce you around.
Make you feel right at home.

17:23.252 --> 17:25.837
I know a couple of big old bull queers

17:25.922 --> 17:28.882
that would just love to make your acquaintance.

17:28.966 --> 17:32.385
Especially that big, white,
m- mushy butt of yours.

17:32.470 --> 17:34.387
God!

17:34.472 --> 17:35.972
I don't belong here!

17:36.057 --> 17:37.474
We have a winner!

17:37.558 --> 17:39.309
I wanna go home!

17:39.393 --> 17:41.227
And it's Fat Ass by a nose!

17:41.312 --> 17:44.481
Hey, it's the fat guy! It's the fat guy!

17:44.565 --> 17:48.401
Fresh fish! Fresh fish! Fresh fish!

17:48.486 --> 17:51.196
I don't belong here!

17:51.280 --> 17:52.489
Fresh fish!

17:52.573 --> 17:55.909
I wanna go home. I want my mommy.

17:55.993 --> 17:58.995
I had your mother. She wasn't that great.

17:59.080 --> 18:00.580
Fresh fish!

18:02.416 --> 18:05.210
What the Christ is this happy horse shit?

18:05.294 --> 18:08.004
He took the Lord's name in vain.
I'm telling the Warden.

18:08.089 --> 18:09.589
With my baton up your ass!

18:09.674 --> 18:11.342
Let me out of here!

18:11.426 --> 18:14.804
What is your malfunction,
you fat barrel of monkey spunk?

18:14.888 --> 18:16.055
Please...

18:16.139 --> 18:18.182
I ain't supposed to be here.

18:18.266 --> 18:19.642
Not me!

18:19.726 --> 18:22.186
I ain't gonna count to three, or even one.

18:22.270 --> 18:24.563
Shut the fuck up, or I'll sing you a lullaby!

18:24.648 --> 18:26.482
Shut up, man. Shut up.

18:26.566 --> 18:27.858
There's been a mistake!

18:27.943 --> 18:31.112
You don't understand.
I'm not supposed to be here!

18:31.196 --> 18:32.279
Open that cell.

18:32.364 --> 18:36.534
Me neither.
You people run this place like a fucking prison!

18:44.001 --> 18:46.043
Son of a bitch.

18:50.215 --> 18:52.299
Take it easy.

19:15.074 --> 19:18.452
If I hear so much as a mouse fart in here
the rest of the night,

19:18.536 --> 19:22.205
I swear by God and sonny Jesus,
you will all visit the infirmary.

19:22.290 --> 19:24.374
Every last motherfucker in here.

19:28.296 --> 19:31.965
Call the trustees.
Take that tub of shit down to the infirmary.

19:46.272 --> 19:50.984
His first night in the joint,
Andy Dufresne cost me two packs of cigarettes.

19:51.069 --> 19:53.945
He never made a sound.

20:09.463 --> 20:12.715
Tier 3 North. Clear.

20:12.800 --> 20:14.967
Tier 2 South. Clear.

20:15.052 --> 20:16.928
Tier 3 South. Clear.

20:17.012 --> 20:18.971
Tier 1 North...

20:19.056 --> 20:21.849
- Tier 1 South. Clear.
- Tier 4 South. Clear.

20:21.934 --> 20:24.018
Prepare to roll out.

20:27.397 --> 20:29.482
Roll out!

21:22.370 --> 21:25.164
Are... Are you going to eat that?

21:25.248 --> 21:28.167
I hadn't... I hadn't planned on it.

21:29.419 --> 21:30.460
Do you mind?

21:37.802 --> 21:40.429
Ah...that's nice and ripe.

21:52.025 --> 21:54.484
Jake says thank you.

21:54.569 --> 21:56.987
Fell out of his nest over by the plate shop.

21:59.240 --> 22:03.786
I'm going to look after him
until he's big enough to fly.

22:03.871 --> 22:05.663
Oh, no, no. Here he comes.

22:08.792 --> 22:12.712
Morning, fellas. Fine morning, ain't it?

22:12.796 --> 22:15.215
You know why it's a fine morning, don't you?

22:15.299 --> 22:17.717
Come on. Set 'em down.
I want 'em all lined up here,

22:17.801 --> 22:20.595
just like a pretty little chorus line.

22:20.679 --> 22:22.764
Yeah, look at that!

22:22.848 --> 22:25.725
- Look at that. Oh, Lord!
- I can't stand this guy.

22:26.936 --> 22:29.604
Yes. Richmond, Virginia.

22:29.688 --> 22:31.773
- Smell my ass!
- After he smells mine.

22:31.857 --> 22:37.195
Gee, Red, it was a terrible shame
about your horse coming in last, an' all.

22:37.279 --> 22:40.490
But I sure do love that winning horse of mine,
though.

22:40.574 --> 22:43.284
I owe that boy a great big, sloppy kiss
when I see him.

22:43.369 --> 22:46.371
Why don't you give him some of your cigarettes,
instead?

22:46.455 --> 22:48.248
Lucky fuck.

22:48.332 --> 22:50.041
Hey, Tyrell.

22:50.125 --> 22:53.086
You pull infirmary duty this week?

22:53.170 --> 22:54.879
How's that horse of mine doing?

22:54.964 --> 22:56.422
Dead.

22:56.507 --> 23:01.887
Hadley busted his head up pretty good.
The doc had already gone home for the night.

23:01.888 --> 23:04.640
Poor bastard lay there till this morning.

23:04.724 --> 23:07.559
By then, hell, there weren't nothing we could do.

23:13.358 --> 23:14.942
What was his name?

23:18.196 --> 23:19.571
What did you say?

23:21.449 --> 23:23.826
I was just wondering if anyone knew his name.

23:23.910 --> 23:26.620
What the fuck do you care, new fish?

23:28.081 --> 23:31.458
It doesn't fuckin' matter what his name was.
He's dead.

23:50.812 --> 23:53.147
Hey...

23:53.231 --> 23:55.983
Anybody come at you yet?

23:57.485 --> 23:59.487
Anybody get to you yet?

24:00.614 --> 24:03.658
Hey, we all need friends in here.

24:03.743 --> 24:05.660
I could be a friend to you.

24:08.122 --> 24:09.789
Hey...

24:14.628 --> 24:16.504
Hard to get.

24:18.174 --> 24:19.841
I like that.

24:26.474 --> 24:29.768
Andy kept pretty much to himself at first.

24:29.852 --> 24:32.312
I guess he had a lot on his mind,

24:32.396 --> 24:34.606
trying to adapt to life on the inside.

24:36.150 --> 24:38.860
It wasn't until a month went by
that he opened his mouth

24:38.944 --> 24:41.237
to say more than two words to somebody.

24:43.157 --> 24:45.200
As it turned out...

24:45.284 --> 24:47.202
that somebody was me.

24:50.790 --> 24:54.959
Officers Russell and Burwell
report to the duty officer.

24:56.003 --> 24:58.756
I'm Andy Dufresne.

24:58.840 --> 25:00.925
The wife-killing banker.

25:02.761 --> 25:04.470
Why did you do it?

25:04.554 --> 25:06.180
I didn't, since you ask.

25:06.264 --> 25:09.308
You're gonna fit right in!

25:09.393 --> 25:12.561
Everybody in here's innocent.
Didn't you know that?

25:12.646 --> 25:15.981
- Heywood, what are you in here for?
- Didn't do it. Lawyer fucked me.

25:18.902 --> 25:21.695
Rumor has it you're a real cold fish.

25:21.780 --> 25:25.533
You think your shit smells sweeter than most.
Is that right?

25:25.617 --> 25:27.952
- What do you think?
- To tell you the truth,

25:28.036 --> 25:31.122
I haven't made up my mind.

25:31.206 --> 25:35.292
I understand
you're a man that knows how to get things.

25:35.377 --> 25:38.879
I'm known to locate certain things,
from time to time.

25:38.964 --> 25:41.966
- I wonder if you might get me a rock hammer.
- A what?

25:42.050 --> 25:43.426
A rock hammer.

25:43.510 --> 25:45.803
- What is it, and why?
- What do you care?

25:47.681 --> 25:50.558
Well, if it was a toothbrush, I'd just quote a price,

25:50.642 --> 25:53.227
but then a toothbrush is a non-lethal object.

25:54.646 --> 25:56.356
Fair enough.

25:56.441 --> 25:58.900
A rock hammer
is about six or seven inches long.

25:58.985 --> 26:00.610
Looks like a miniature pickaxe.

26:00.695 --> 26:01.820
Pickaxe?

26:01.904 --> 26:03.989
- For rocks.
- Rocks.

26:05.658 --> 26:07.826
Quartz?

26:07.910 --> 26:09.578
Quartz.

26:10.830 --> 26:13.206
And some mica.

26:13.291 --> 26:14.458
Shale.

26:15.543 --> 26:17.127
Limestone.

26:17.211 --> 26:19.129
So?

26:19.213 --> 26:21.298
So, I'm a rock hound.

26:21.382 --> 26:24.593
At least, I was in my old life.
I'd like to be again on a limited basis.

26:24.677 --> 26:26.803
Or maybe you want
to hammer somebody's skull.

26:26.888 --> 26:28.346
No, sir.

26:29.474 --> 26:31.057
I have no enemies here.

26:31.142 --> 26:33.518
No? Wait a while.

26:35.062 --> 26:37.230
Word gets around.

26:37.315 --> 26:40.442
The Sisters have taken quite a liking to you.

26:40.526 --> 26:42.319
Especially Bogs.

26:43.404 --> 26:47.616
I don't suppose it would help any
if I explained to them I'm not homosexual.

26:47.700 --> 26:49.201
Neither are they.

26:49.285 --> 26:51.995
You have to be human first. They don't qualify.

26:57.252 --> 27:01.797
Bull queers take by force.
It's all they want or understand.

27:01.882 --> 27:05.510
If I were you,
I'd grow eyes in the back of my head.

27:05.594 --> 27:06.928
Thanks for the advice.

27:07.012 --> 27:08.596
Well, that's free.

27:08.680 --> 27:10.932
You understand my concern.

27:11.016 --> 27:13.559
Well, if there's any trouble,
I won't use the hammer.

27:13.644 --> 27:17.855
Then I guess you want to escape.
Tunnel under the wall, maybe.

27:19.316 --> 27:21.108
Did I miss something? What's funny?

27:21.193 --> 27:24.237
You'll understand
when you see the rock hammer.

27:26.114 --> 27:28.115
What's an item like this usually go for?

27:28.200 --> 27:31.244
Seven dollars in any rock and gem shop.

27:31.328 --> 27:34.038
My normal mark-up's 20 per cent.

27:34.039 --> 27:36.582
But this is a specialty item.

27:36.667 --> 27:39.252
The risk goes up, the price goes up.

27:39.253 --> 27:41.212
Let's make it an even ten bucks.

27:41.296 --> 27:43.172
Ten it is.

27:44.258 --> 27:46.676
Waste of money, if you ask me.

27:46.760 --> 27:48.302
Why's that?

27:49.388 --> 27:52.432
Folks around this joint love surprise inspections.

27:54.018 --> 27:56.311
If they find it, you're gonna lose it.

27:56.396 --> 27:58.522
If they do catch you with it, you don't know me.

27:58.606 --> 28:00.816
Mention my name, we never do business again.

28:00.900 --> 28:04.027
Not for shoelaces or a stick of gum.
Now, you got that?

28:05.530 --> 28:06.947
I understand.

28:07.031 --> 28:08.448
Thank you...

28:08.449 --> 28:10.075
Mr. er...?

28:10.159 --> 28:12.619
Red. The name's Red.

28:12.620 --> 28:13.662
Red?

28:13.746 --> 28:16.498
Why do they call you that?

28:20.169 --> 28:22.254
Maybe it's because I'm Irish.

28:30.221 --> 28:33.265
I could see
why some of the boys took him for snobby.

28:33.349 --> 28:36.768
He had a quiet way about him.

28:36.853 --> 28:41.315
A walk and a talk
that just wasn't normal around here.

28:41.399 --> 28:42.941
He strolled...

28:43.026 --> 28:47.362
like a man in a park,
without a care or worry in the world.

28:47.447 --> 28:52.160
Like he had on an invisible coat
that would shield him from this place.

28:52.244 --> 28:56.414
Yeah. I think it would be fair to say...

28:56.415 --> 28:58.499
I liked Andy from the start.

29:00.252 --> 29:03.463
Let's go!
Some of us have got a schedule to keep.

29:06.759 --> 29:08.843
Move it! Come on. Move it!

29:12.473 --> 29:15.600
Bob, how are you doing?
How's the wife treating you?

29:25.319 --> 29:26.778
Easy.

29:26.862 --> 29:28.946
Keep it moving.

29:31.742 --> 29:32.992
Red...

29:53.515 --> 29:57.726
Andy was right. I finally got the joke.

29:57.811 --> 30:02.314
It would take a man about 600 years
to tunnel under the wall with one of these.

30:06.653 --> 30:07.778
Book?

30:07.862 --> 30:09.738
Not today.

30:15.078 --> 30:17.162
- Book?
- No.

30:18.957 --> 30:20.165
Hey, Brooksy.

30:23.461 --> 30:25.546
Delivery for Dufresne.

30:32.637 --> 30:38.267
Book?

30:41.271 --> 30:43.397
Dufresne...

30:43.481 --> 30:45.650
Here's your book.

30:50.072 --> 30:51.740
Thanks.

30:55.578 --> 30:58.788
Dufresne! We're running low on Hexlite.

30:58.873 --> 31:00.957
Get on back and fetch us up some.

31:38.162 --> 31:40.121
If you get this in your eyes, it blinds you.

31:40.206 --> 31:42.957
Honey...hush.

31:55.013 --> 31:57.431
That's it. You fight.

31:57.516 --> 31:59.099
It's better that way.

32:07.526 --> 32:10.361
I wish I could tell you
that Andy fought the good fight,

32:10.445 --> 32:12.988
and the Sisters let him be.

32:13.073 --> 32:15.074
I wish I could tell you that.

32:15.158 --> 32:17.243
But prison is no fairy-tale world.

32:19.204 --> 32:21.330
He never said who did it.

32:21.414 --> 32:24.458
But we all knew.

32:27.796 --> 32:30.673
Things went on like that for a while.

32:30.757 --> 32:33.384
Prison life consists of routine...

32:33.468 --> 32:35.678
and then more routine.

32:38.056 --> 32:41.893
Every so often,
Andy would show up with fresh bruises.

32:43.062 --> 32:45.105
The Sisters kept at him.

32:45.189 --> 32:49.317
Sometimes he was able to fight 'em off.
Sometimes not.

32:49.402 --> 32:52.654
And that's how it went for Andy.

32:52.738 --> 32:55.282
That was his routine.

32:55.366 --> 32:59.160
I do believe
those first two years were the worst for him.

32:59.245 --> 33:01.496
And I also believe,

33:01.581 --> 33:06.126
if things had gone on that way,
this place would have got the best of him.

33:06.210 --> 33:09.170
But then, in the spring of 1949,

33:09.255 --> 33:11.256
the powers that be decided that...

33:11.340 --> 33:14.759
The roof of the license-plate factory
needs resurfacing.

33:14.844 --> 33:17.596
I need a dozen volunteers for a week's work.

33:18.764 --> 33:20.891
As you know,

33:20.975 --> 33:24.686
special detail carries with it special privileges.

33:24.770 --> 33:26.855
It was outdoor detail...

33:28.357 --> 33:31.943
..and May is one damn fine month
to be working outdoors.

33:32.028 --> 33:33.653
Stay in line there.

33:33.738 --> 33:36.656
More than a hundred men
volunteered for the job.

33:41.038 --> 33:43.331
Wallace E Unger.

33:44.499 --> 33:46.959
Ellis Redding.

33:47.044 --> 33:49.879
Wouldn't you know it?

33:49.963 --> 33:52.548
Me and some fellows I know
were among the names.

33:52.633 --> 33:54.717
Andrew Dufresne.

33:54.801 --> 33:58.346
It only cost us a pack of smokes per man.

33:58.430 --> 34:01.140
I made my usual 20 per cent, of course.

34:01.224 --> 34:04.810
So, this big-shot lawyer
calls me long-distance from Texas.

34:04.895 --> 34:06.604
I say, "Yeah?"

34:06.688 --> 34:10.399
He says, "Sorry to inform you,
but your brother just died."

34:10.484 --> 34:12.985
Oh, damn, Byron. I'm sorry to hear that.

34:13.070 --> 34:14.445
I'm not. He was an asshole.

34:14.529 --> 34:16.864
Ran off years ago.
Figured him for dead, anyway.

34:16.949 --> 34:20.910
So, anyway, this lawyer fella says to me,
"Your brother died a rich man."

34:20.994 --> 34:23.704
Oil wells and shit. Close to a million bucks.

34:23.789 --> 34:26.248
A million bucks?

34:26.333 --> 34:28.709
Fucking incredible
how lucky some assholes get.

34:28.794 --> 34:31.337
Jeez-Louise! Are you gonna see any of that?

34:31.421 --> 34:34.507
35,000. That's what he left me.

34:34.591 --> 34:36.509
- Dollars?
- Yeah.

34:36.593 --> 34:39.721
Holy shit! That's great.
That's like winning the sweepstakes.

34:39.806 --> 34:41.014
Isn't it?

34:41.099 --> 34:44.142
Dumb shit. What do you think
the government's gonna do to me?

34:44.227 --> 34:46.770
Take a big, wet bite out of my ass, is what.

34:46.771 --> 34:50.941
Poor Byron! Terrible fucking luck, huh?

34:51.025 --> 34:53.694
Crying shame.

34:53.778 --> 34:55.445
Some people really got it awful!

34:55.530 --> 34:57.072
Andy, are you nuts?

34:57.156 --> 34:59.282
Keep your eyes on your mop, man. Andy!

34:59.283 --> 35:02.327
Well, you'll pay some tax,
but you'll still end up...

35:02.412 --> 35:05.247
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Maybe enough to buy a new car. Then what?

35:05.331 --> 35:07.708
I've got to pay tax on the car.

35:07.792 --> 35:11.670
Repair, maintenance, goddamn kids
pestering me to take them for a ride...

35:11.754 --> 35:15.674
And at the end of the year, you figure the tax
wrong, you pay them out of your own pocket.

35:15.758 --> 35:17.926
I tell you...Uncle Sam!

35:18.011 --> 35:21.763
He puts his hand in your shirt
and squeezes your tit till it's purple.

35:21.848 --> 35:24.558
- Andy! Andy!
- What's he doing?

35:24.642 --> 35:26.977
- Getting himself killed.
- Keep tarring.

35:27.061 --> 35:30.147
Some brother! Shit.

35:30.231 --> 35:31.273
Hey!

35:34.610 --> 35:36.821
Mr. Hadley...

35:36.822 --> 35:38.281
do you trust your wife?

35:39.825 --> 35:41.576
Oh, that's funny.

35:41.660 --> 35:44.537
You're gonna look funnier
sucking my dick with no teeth.

35:44.621 --> 35:48.082
I mean, do you think
she'd go behind your back, try to hamstring you?

35:49.168 --> 35:51.044
That's it. Step aside, Mert.

35:51.128 --> 35:52.628
This fucker's having an accident.

35:52.713 --> 35:53.880
He's gonna push him off.

35:53.964 --> 35:58.092
Cos if you do trust her,
there's no reason you can't keep that 35,000.

35:58.177 --> 36:00.053
- What did you say?
- 35,000.

36:00.137 --> 36:01.846
- 35,000?
- All of it.

36:01.847 --> 36:04.182
- All of it?
- Every penny.

36:04.266 --> 36:06.100
You'd better start making sense.

36:06.185 --> 36:08.519
If you want to keep the money,
give it to your wife.

36:08.604 --> 36:12.732
The IRS allows a one-time-only gift
to your spouse for up to $60,000.

36:12.816 --> 36:14.358
Bullshit! Tax-free?

36:14.359 --> 36:17.528
Tax-free. The IRS can't touch one cent.

36:17.613 --> 36:20.198
You're the smart banker what killed his wife.

36:20.282 --> 36:23.826
Why should I believe a smart banker like you?
So I can end up in here with you?

36:23.911 --> 36:25.411
It's legal. Ask the IRS.

36:25.496 --> 36:28.706
They'll say the same thing.
But I feel stupid telling you this.

36:28.791 --> 36:31.084
I'm sure you would have investigated the matter.

36:31.168 --> 36:35.255
Yeah, I don't need no banker to tell me
where the bears shit in the buckwheat.

36:35.340 --> 36:38.383
Of course not, but you do need someone
to set up the tax-free gift.

36:38.468 --> 36:40.344
It'll cost you. A lawyer.

36:40.428 --> 36:42.763
A bunch of ball-washing bastards.

36:42.847 --> 36:46.683
I suppose I could set it up for you.
That would save you some money.

36:46.684 --> 36:49.061
If you get the forms, I'll prepare them for you.

36:49.145 --> 36:51.021
Nearly free of charge.

36:52.107 --> 36:55.484
I'd only ask three beers apiece
for each of my co-workers.

36:55.568 --> 36:57.986
Co-workers! Get him! That's rich, ain't it?

36:58.071 --> 37:01.532
I think a man working outdoors
feels more like a man

37:01.616 --> 37:03.367
if he can have a bottle of suds.

37:03.451 --> 37:06.495
That's only my opinion...sir.

37:09.916 --> 37:11.458
What are you jimmies staring at?

37:11.543 --> 37:12.543
Back to work!

37:12.627 --> 37:14.586
Let's go. Work.

37:22.971 --> 37:28.475
And that's how it came to pass...
that on the second-to-last day of the job,

37:28.560 --> 37:33.231
the convict crew that tarred the plate-factory roof
in the spring of '49...

37:33.315 --> 37:36.526
wound up sitting in a row
at ten o'clock in the morning,

37:36.610 --> 37:40.488
drinking icy-cold, Bohemia-style beer...

37:40.573 --> 37:45.785
courtesy of the hardest screw that ever
walked a turn at Shawshank State Prison.

37:45.870 --> 37:47.954
Drink up while it's cold, ladies.

37:49.331 --> 37:53.501
The colossal prick
even managed to sound magnanimous.

37:55.254 --> 37:59.883
We sat and drank with the sun on our shoulders,
and felt like free men.

37:59.967 --> 38:03.469
Hell, we could have been tarring the roof
of one of our own houses.

38:03.554 --> 38:06.848
We were the lords of all creation.

38:06.932 --> 38:11.477
As for Andy,
he spent that break hunkered in the shade...

38:11.562 --> 38:14.272
a strange little smile on his face,

38:14.356 --> 38:16.441
watching us drink his beer.

38:23.199 --> 38:24.741
Hey...

38:24.825 --> 38:26.117
Want a cold one, Andy?

38:26.202 --> 38:27.869
No, thanks.

38:27.953 --> 38:29.746
I gave up drinking.

38:33.585 --> 38:36.754
You could argue
he'd done it to curry favor with the guards.

38:36.838 --> 38:39.673
Or maybe make a few friends among us cons.

38:41.927 --> 38:45.387
Me, I think he did it just to feel normal again.

38:46.473 --> 38:48.557
If only for a short while.

38:51.436 --> 38:53.771
King me.

38:53.855 --> 38:56.273
Chess. Now, there's a game of kings.

38:56.358 --> 38:58.901
- What?
- Civilized, strategic.

38:58.985 --> 39:01.320
And a total fucking mystery.

39:01.404 --> 39:02.613
I hate it.

39:02.697 --> 39:04.615
Maybe you'll let me teach you someday.

39:04.699 --> 39:07.159
Yeah. Sure.

39:07.244 --> 39:09.370
I thought of getting a board together.

39:09.454 --> 39:12.248
Well, I'm the right man.
I'm the guy that can get things.

39:12.332 --> 39:13.832
We might do business on a board.

39:13.917 --> 39:16.710
But I want to carve the pieces myself.

39:16.795 --> 39:20.381
One side in alabaster, the opposing side
in soapstone. What do you think?

39:20.465 --> 39:22.383
I think it'll take years.

39:22.467 --> 39:25.052
Well, years I got.
What I don't have are the rocks.

39:25.136 --> 39:27.304
Pickings are pretty slim in the yard.

39:27.389 --> 39:29.349
Pebbles, mostly.

39:33.688 --> 39:36.564
Andy, we're getting to be kinda friends,
aren't we?

39:36.649 --> 39:38.316
Yeah, I guess.

39:39.443 --> 39:41.861
Can I ask you something?

39:41.946 --> 39:43.947
Why did you do it?

39:45.157 --> 39:49.035
I'm innocent, Red. Just like everybody else here.

39:53.332 --> 39:55.417
What are you in for?

39:57.420 --> 39:58.420
Murder.

39:58.504 --> 39:59.921
Same as you.

40:00.006 --> 40:01.172
Innocent?

40:03.843 --> 40:05.927
Only guilty man in Shawshank.

41:05.405 --> 41:06.989
Where's the canary?

41:07.074 --> 41:08.407
How did you know?

41:08.408 --> 41:09.575
How did I know what?

41:09.659 --> 41:12.078
So, you don't know? Come.

41:14.831 --> 41:16.957
This is where the canary is, Johnny.

41:19.336 --> 41:23.339
Quite a surprise to hear a woman singing
in my house, eh, Johnny?

41:26.260 --> 41:28.637
That's quite a...

41:28.721 --> 41:30.389
surprise.

41:32.892 --> 41:34.601
Red...

41:34.685 --> 41:36.478
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

41:36.562 --> 41:38.397
Here she comes.

41:38.481 --> 41:41.358
This is the part I like -
when she does that shit with her hair.

41:41.442 --> 41:44.361
Yeah, I know. I've seen it three times this month.

41:44.445 --> 41:46.446
Gilda, are you decent?

41:46.531 --> 41:48.573
Me?

41:50.284 --> 41:52.327
Hah! God, I love it!

41:58.209 --> 42:02.003
I understand
you're a man that knows how to get things.

42:02.088 --> 42:05.966
Yeah, I'm known to locate certain things
from time to time. What do you want?

42:06.050 --> 42:08.552
- Rita Hayworth.
- What?

42:08.636 --> 42:10.470
Can you get her?

42:11.556 --> 42:15.016
So, this is Johnny Farrell.
I've heard a lot about you, Johnny.

42:15.101 --> 42:16.977
Take a few weeks.

42:17.061 --> 42:18.270
Weeks?

42:18.271 --> 42:23.526
Well, yeah, Andy. I don't have her stuffed down
the front of my pants right now, I'm sorry to say.

42:23.610 --> 42:26.112
But I'll get her. Relax.

42:28.365 --> 42:29.866
Thanks.

42:29.950 --> 42:31.951
- It was a surprise, Mr. Farrell.
- It was.

42:32.035 --> 42:33.077
Sit down.

42:33.162 --> 42:35.079
Did you tell him what I'm doing here?

42:35.164 --> 42:37.999
No, I wanted to save that as a surprise, too.

42:38.083 --> 42:39.750
Hang on to your hat, Mr. Farrell...

42:49.845 --> 42:52.096
- Take a walk.
- I gotta change the reel.

42:52.181 --> 42:54.265
I said fuck off!

42:59.104 --> 43:01.898
Ain't you gonna scream?

43:03.275 --> 43:05.067
Let's get this over with.

43:09.198 --> 43:10.823
He broke my fuckin' nose!

43:21.336 --> 43:25.380
Now...I'm gonna open my fly...

43:25.465 --> 43:28.425
and you're gonna swallow
what I give you to swallow.

43:29.511 --> 43:31.303
Then you're gonna swallow Rooster's.

43:31.387 --> 43:34.223
You broke his nose,
he ought to have something to show for it.

43:34.307 --> 43:36.517
Anything you put in my mouth,
you're gonna lose.

43:36.601 --> 43:39.353
No. You don't understand.

43:39.437 --> 43:42.731
You do that, and I'll put
all eight inches of this steel in your ear.

43:42.732 --> 43:43.815
All right.

43:43.900 --> 43:48.529
But you should know that sudden, serious
brain injury causes the victim to bite down hard.

43:49.781 --> 43:52.199
In fact, I hear the bite reflex is so strong,

43:52.283 --> 43:57.079
they have to pry the victim's jaws open...
with a crowbar.

43:59.916 --> 44:01.542
Where did you get this shit?

44:01.626 --> 44:03.293
I read it.

44:04.379 --> 44:07.256
Know how to read, you ignorant fuck?

44:08.758 --> 44:10.634
Honey...

44:11.886 --> 44:14.263
..you shouldn't.

44:16.307 --> 44:19.310
Bogs didn't put anything in Andy's mouth...

44:19.395 --> 44:21.771
and neither did his friends.

44:21.855 --> 44:25.149
What they did do...
is beat him within an inch of his life.

44:26.360 --> 44:28.361
Andy spent a month in the infirmary.

44:29.405 --> 44:31.906
Bogs spent a week in the hole.

44:36.370 --> 44:37.996
Time's up, Bogs.

44:41.667 --> 44:43.751
It's your world, boss.

44:45.838 --> 44:49.257
Return to your cell blocks for evening count.

44:49.341 --> 44:51.509
All prisoners report for lockdown.

45:07.067 --> 45:08.359
What?

45:20.832 --> 45:23.542
Where's he going?
Grab his ankles.

45:25.128 --> 45:27.630
No! No!

45:27.714 --> 45:29.089
No!

45:29.174 --> 45:30.507
Help me...

45:30.592 --> 45:31.884
Aaarghh!

45:34.179 --> 45:36.847
Two things never happened again after that.

45:36.931 --> 45:39.767
The Sisters never laid a finger on Andy again...

45:40.977 --> 45:43.687
..and Bogs never walked again.

45:44.814 --> 45:48.233
They transferred him
to a minimum-security hospital upstate.

45:48.318 --> 45:54.031
To my knowledge, he lived out the rest
of his days drinking his food through a straw.

45:54.115 --> 45:58.786
I'm thinking Andy could use a nice welcome
back when he gets out of the infirmary.

45:59.913 --> 46:03.707
Sounds good to us.
I figure we owe him that much for the beer.

46:05.085 --> 46:07.753
The man likes to play chess.

46:07.837 --> 46:09.922
Let's get him some rocks.

46:42.331 --> 46:44.207
Guys...

46:44.291 --> 46:46.668
I got one. I got one. Look.

46:49.088 --> 46:51.172
Heywood, that isn't soapstone.

46:51.257 --> 46:53.466
And it ain't alabaster, either.

46:53.551 --> 46:55.176
What are you, a fucking geologist?

46:55.261 --> 46:57.303
He's right. It ain't.

46:57.388 --> 46:58.638
Well, what the hell is it?

46:58.723 --> 47:01.266
A horse apple.

47:01.350 --> 47:04.477
- Bullshit.
- No, horse shit. Petrified.

47:10.860 --> 47:13.738
Oh, Jesus Christ!

47:13.822 --> 47:15.781
Oh, damn!

47:15.866 --> 47:19.827
Despite a few hitches,
the boys came through in fine style.

47:21.037 --> 47:23.664
And by the weekend he was due back,
we had enough rocks

47:23.749 --> 47:26.792
to keep him busy till rapture.

47:26.877 --> 47:29.587
I also got a big shipment in that week.

47:29.671 --> 47:32.214
Cigarettes. Chewing gum.

47:32.299 --> 47:33.799
Sipping whisky.

47:33.884 --> 47:37.428
Playing cards with naked ladies on them.
You name it.

47:37.512 --> 47:40.473
And of course, the most important item.

47:42.225 --> 47:44.310
Rita Hayworth herself.

48:18.471 --> 48:21.306
OK, look alive! Open all tiers.

48:21.390 --> 48:23.725
Heads up. They're tossing the cells.

48:23.810 --> 48:26.061
Heads up. They're tossing the cells.

48:28.189 --> 48:30.065
119.

48:31.567 --> 48:33.235
123.

48:42.703 --> 48:44.579
On your feet.

48:46.290 --> 48:48.166
Face the wall.

49:22.661 --> 49:24.745
Turn around and face the Warden.

49:30.460 --> 49:32.545
Pleased to see you reading this.

49:33.922 --> 49:36.215
Any favorite passages?

49:37.259 --> 49:42.388
"Watch ye, therefore, for ye know not
when the master of the house cometh."

49:43.432 --> 49:46.309
Mark 13:35.

49:46.393 --> 49:49.061
I always liked that one.

49:49.146 --> 49:50.646
But I prefer...

49:50.731 --> 49:53.482
"I'm the light of the world.

49:53.567 --> 49:57.111
He that followeth me shall not walk in darkness,
but shall have the light of life."

49:57.195 --> 49:59.780
John, Chapter 8, Verse 12.

49:59.865 --> 50:03.326
I hear you're good with numbers. How nice.

50:04.453 --> 50:06.537
A man should have a skill.

50:08.625 --> 50:10.083
Wanna explain this?

50:11.169 --> 50:14.630
It's called a rock blanket.
It's for shaping and polishing rocks.

50:15.673 --> 50:17.633
A little hobby of mine.

50:28.478 --> 50:31.480
It's pretty clean. Some contraband here,

50:31.564 --> 50:33.649
but nothing to get in a twist over.

50:37.487 --> 50:39.571
I can't say I approve of this.

50:41.074 --> 50:42.783
But I suppose...

50:44.744 --> 50:46.620
..exceptions can be made.

50:57.006 --> 50:59.299
Lock 'em up!

51:01.302 --> 51:03.261
I almost forgot.

51:03.346 --> 51:05.598
I'd hate to deprive you of this.

51:05.683 --> 51:07.141
Salvation lies within.

51:08.227 --> 51:09.560
Yes, sir.

51:17.861 --> 51:20.446
Tossing cells was just an excuse.

51:20.990 --> 51:24.575
The truth is, Norton wanted to size Andy up.

51:38.215 --> 51:41.342
My wife made that in church group.

51:43.679 --> 51:45.013
Very nice, sir.

51:46.181 --> 51:48.057
Do you enjoy working in the laundry?

51:49.685 --> 51:51.394
No, sir, not especially.

51:51.478 --> 51:54.272
Perhaps we can find something more...

51:54.356 --> 51:56.441
befitting a man of your education.

52:04.784 --> 52:06.452
Hey, Jake. Where's Brooks?

52:06.536 --> 52:07.828
Andy.

52:07.912 --> 52:10.205
I thought I heard you out here!

52:11.708 --> 52:13.292
I've been reassigned to you.

52:13.376 --> 52:16.545
I know. They told me.

52:16.629 --> 52:18.714
Ain't that a kick in the head?

52:18.798 --> 52:21.300
Well, I'll give you the dime tour.

52:21.384 --> 52:23.469
Come on.

52:23.553 --> 52:25.721
Well, here she is.

52:25.805 --> 52:28.348
Shawshank Prison library.

52:28.433 --> 52:31.310
National Geographics.

52:31.394 --> 52:34.229
Reader's Digest condensed books.

52:34.314 --> 52:36.607
Louis L'Amour.

52:36.608 --> 52:38.734
Look Magazine.

52:38.818 --> 52:41.320
Erle Stanley Gardners.

52:41.404 --> 52:44.948
Every evening,
I load up the cart and make my round.

52:44.949 --> 52:48.118
I enter the names on this clipboard here.

52:48.203 --> 52:51.663
Easy-peasy, Japanesey. Any questions?

52:51.748 --> 52:54.708
Brooks, how long have you been librarian?

52:54.793 --> 52:59.963
Oh...I come here in '05,
and they made me librarian in 1912.

53:00.048 --> 53:03.426
And in all that time,
have you ever had an assistant?

53:03.511 --> 53:06.096
No. No, not much to it, really.

53:06.180 --> 53:08.098
Well, why me? Why now?

53:08.182 --> 53:09.682
I don't know,

53:09.767 --> 53:13.103
but it'll be nice to have some company
down here for a change.

53:13.104 --> 53:15.188
Dufresne!

53:24.490 --> 53:26.574
That's him. That's the one.

53:34.125 --> 53:35.416
I'm Dekins.

53:35.501 --> 53:37.961
I was er...

53:38.045 --> 53:42.048
thinking about maybe setting up
some kind of trust fund for my kids' educations.

53:44.385 --> 53:45.844
Oh...

53:45.928 --> 53:47.595
I see.

53:49.056 --> 53:50.932
Well, erm...

53:52.309 --> 53:53.852
..why don't we have a seat,

53:53.936 --> 53:56.020
and talk it over?

53:58.566 --> 54:01.485
Brooks,
do you have a piece of paper and a pencil?

54:12.956 --> 54:14.665
Thanks.

54:14.749 --> 54:16.417
So...

54:17.669 --> 54:20.171
Mr. Dekins...

54:20.255 --> 54:24.717
And then Andy says to Mr. Dekins,
"Do you want your sons to go to Harvard,

54:24.801 --> 54:26.927
- or Yale?"
- He didn't say that?

54:27.012 --> 54:29.680
As God is my witness, he did!

54:29.764 --> 54:33.142
Dekins just blinked for a second.
Then he laughed himself silly.

54:33.226 --> 54:35.102
And afterwards he shook Andy's hand.

54:35.187 --> 54:36.562
My ass!

54:36.646 --> 54:37.855
Shook his hand.

54:37.939 --> 54:40.900
Hell, I...I near soiled myself!

54:40.984 --> 54:45.196
All Andy needed was a suit and a tie
and a little jiggly hula girl on his desk,

54:45.280 --> 54:46.614
and he would have been:

54:46.698 --> 54:48.240
"Mr. Dufresne, if you please"!

54:48.325 --> 54:50.075
Making a few friends, Andy?

54:51.119 --> 54:53.078
I wouldn't say "friends".

54:53.163 --> 54:57.167
I'm a convicted murderer
who provides sound financial planning.

54:57.251 --> 54:59.586
It's a wonderful pet to have.

54:59.670 --> 55:01.588
Got you out of the laundry, though.

55:01.672 --> 55:03.882
Well, it might do more than that.

55:03.966 --> 55:06.968
How about expanding the library?
Get some new books in there.

55:07.053 --> 55:09.763
If you're gonna ask for something,
ask for a pool table.

55:09.847 --> 55:12.307
- Right.
- How do you expect to do that?

55:12.391 --> 55:17.646
I mean, get new books in here,
Mr. Dufresne, if you please?

55:17.730 --> 55:19.481
Ask the Warden for funds.

55:20.900 --> 55:24.194
Son, son. Six wardens
have been through here in my tenure,

55:24.278 --> 55:27.906
and I've learned one immutable, universal truth.

55:27.990 --> 55:29.699
Not one of them born...

55:29.700 --> 55:34.663
whose asshole wouldn't pucker up tighter than
a snare drum when you asked them for funds.

55:34.747 --> 55:37.040
The budget's stretched thin, as it is.

55:37.124 --> 55:38.375
I see.

55:38.459 --> 55:42.003
Perhaps I could write to the State Senate
and request funds from them.

55:42.088 --> 55:46.466
As far as they're concerned, there's only three
ways to spend money when it comes to prisons:

55:46.550 --> 55:48.635
more walls, more bars and more guards.

55:48.719 --> 55:53.139
Still, I'd like to try, with your permission.
A letter a week. They can't ignore me forever.

55:53.224 --> 55:54.766
Sure can.

55:54.850 --> 55:57.728
But you write your letters, if it makes you happy.

55:57.813 --> 56:00.106
I'll even mail them for you. How's that?

56:02.025 --> 56:05.069
So, Andy started writing a letter a week,

56:05.153 --> 56:07.238
just like he said.

56:11.285 --> 56:15.413
And, just like Norton said, Andy got no answers.

56:23.255 --> 56:28.759
The following April, Andy did tax returns
for half the guards at Shawshank.

56:28.844 --> 56:31.929
The year after that, he did them all...

56:32.014 --> 56:34.098
including the Warden's.

56:35.475 --> 56:39.228
The year after that, they rescheduled
the start of the intramural season

56:39.313 --> 56:41.397
to coincide with tax season.

56:43.692 --> 56:47.903
The guards on the opposing teams
all remembered to bring their W-2s.

56:47.988 --> 56:52.116
So, Moresby Prison issued you your gun,
but you had to pay for it?

56:52.200 --> 56:53.952
Damn right. The holster, too.

56:54.037 --> 56:55.287
That's tax-deductible.

56:55.371 --> 56:56.538
You can write that off.

56:56.622 --> 56:59.958
Yes, sir.
Andy was a regular cottage industry.

57:00.043 --> 57:03.086
In fact, it got so busy at tax time...

57:03.171 --> 57:05.213
he was allowed a staff.

57:05.298 --> 57:07.758
Hey, Red, can you hand me a stack of 1040s?

57:07.842 --> 57:10.510
It got me out of the wood shop
a month out of the year,

57:10.595 --> 57:13.263
and that was fine by me.

57:13.348 --> 57:16.725
And still...he kept sending those letters.

57:22.023 --> 57:23.857
Red, Andy.

57:23.941 --> 57:25.150
It's Brooks.

57:25.234 --> 57:27.694
Watch the door.

57:27.779 --> 57:29.363
Please, Brooks.

57:29.447 --> 57:31.448
- Just calm the fuck down.
- Stay back!

57:31.532 --> 57:33.575
- Stay back!
- What the hell's going on?

57:33.659 --> 57:36.745
You tell me. One second he's fine.
Then out comes the knife.

57:36.829 --> 57:39.289
Brooks, we can talk about this. Right?

57:39.374 --> 57:41.500
Nothing to talk about, goddamn it!

57:41.584 --> 57:43.293
I'm gonna cut his fucking throat.

57:43.378 --> 57:45.253
Heywood? Wait, what's he done to you?

57:45.338 --> 57:47.464
It's what they done!

57:47.548 --> 57:48.965
I...I got no choice...

57:49.050 --> 57:51.719
You're not gonna hurt him.
Even Heywood knows that.

57:51.804 --> 57:54.430
- Right, Heywood?
- I...I know that, sure.

57:54.515 --> 57:57.934
You won't hurt him, because he's a friend,
and you're a reasonable man.

57:58.018 --> 57:59.310
That's right. Right, guys?

57:59.395 --> 58:02.772
- Yes.
- So, put the knife down. Brooks, look at me.

58:02.856 --> 58:04.690
Put the knife down.

58:05.776 --> 58:06.943
Brooks...

58:07.027 --> 58:09.278
Look at his neck, for God's sake.

58:09.363 --> 58:11.697
Brooks, look at his neck. It's bleeding.

58:13.033 --> 58:14.617
It's the only...

58:14.701 --> 58:16.994
It's the only way they'd let me stay.

58:17.079 --> 58:19.664
Come on. This is crazy.
You don't want to do this.

58:19.665 --> 58:21.749
Put it down.

58:29.133 --> 58:33.845
Come on. Take it easy.
You're going to be all right.

58:33.929 --> 58:35.304
Him?

58:35.389 --> 58:39.058
Hell, what about me?
Crazy old fool damn near cut my throat.

58:39.143 --> 58:41.769
Shit, Heywood,
you've had worse from shaving.

58:41.854 --> 58:44.105
What the hell did you do to set him off, anyway?

58:44.189 --> 58:46.524
Nothing. I come in here to say fare-thee-well.

58:46.608 --> 58:49.736
Ain't you heard? His parole's come through.

58:51.781 --> 58:54.908
I just don't understand what happened in there.
That's all.

58:54.993 --> 58:57.578
The old man's as crazy
as a rat in a tin shithouse.

58:57.662 --> 58:59.872
Oh, Heywood, that's enough out of you.

58:59.956 --> 59:02.958
- I heard he had you shitting in your pants.
- Fuck you!

59:03.042 --> 59:04.418
Would you knock it off?

59:04.502 --> 59:06.837
Brooks ain't no bug.

59:06.921 --> 59:08.797
He's just...

59:10.675 --> 59:12.509
He's just institutionalized.

59:13.845 --> 59:15.512
Institutionalized, my ass.

59:15.597 --> 59:19.892
The man's been in here 50 years, Heywood.
50 years.

59:19.976 --> 59:21.685
This is all he knows.

59:21.769 --> 59:24.188
In here, he's an important man.

59:24.272 --> 59:25.731
He's an educated man.

59:25.815 --> 59:27.900
Outside, he's nothing.

59:30.069 --> 59:32.696
Just a used-up con with arthritis in both hands.

59:32.780 --> 59:35.991
Probably couldn't get a library card if he tried.

59:36.075 --> 59:38.160
You know what I'm trying to say?

59:38.244 --> 59:40.996
Red, I do believe you're talking out of your ass.

59:42.248 --> 59:45.167
You believe whatever you want, Floyd.

59:45.168 --> 59:47.712
But I'm telling you, these walls are funny.

59:49.131 --> 59:51.216
First you hate 'em...

59:52.760 --> 59:54.844
..then you get used to 'em.

59:56.472 --> 59:59.098
Enough time passes...

59:59.183 --> 01:00:02.143
you get so you depend on 'em.

01:00:02.228 --> 01:00:04.562
That's institutionalized.

01:00:04.647 --> 01:00:06.022
Shit.

01:00:06.023 --> 01:00:07.649
You can never get like that.

01:00:07.733 --> 01:00:09.651
Oh, yeah?

01:00:09.735 --> 01:00:12.320
Say that when you've been here
as long as Brooks has.

01:00:12.404 --> 01:00:14.280
Goddamn right.

01:00:16.617 --> 01:00:19.160
They send you here for life.

01:00:19.245 --> 01:00:21.329
That's exactly what they take.

01:00:23.249 --> 01:00:25.333
The part that counts, anyway.

01:00:32.841 --> 01:00:35.009
I can't take care of you no more, Jake.

01:00:36.929 --> 01:00:38.763
You go on, now.

01:00:39.848 --> 01:00:44.519
You're free.

01:01:00.412 --> 01:01:02.288
Bye.

01:01:03.373 --> 01:01:05.291
Good luck, Brooks.

01:01:41.870 --> 01:01:44.581
Dear fellas...

01:01:44.665 --> 01:01:48.877
I can't believe
how fast things move on the outside.

01:01:50.296 --> 01:01:53.340
Watch it, old-timer! Are you trying to get killed?

01:01:53.424 --> 01:01:56.760
I saw an automobile once, when I was a kid,

01:01:56.844 --> 01:01:59.763
but now...they're everywhere.

01:02:03.976 --> 01:02:07.562
The world went and got itself
in a big damn hurry.

01:02:23.913 --> 01:02:30.210
The parole board got me into
this halfway house called The Brewer,

01:02:30.294 --> 01:02:34.089
and a job bagging groceries at the Foodway.

01:02:36.133 --> 01:02:41.471
It's hard work, and I try to keep up,
but my hands hurt most of the time.

01:02:41.556 --> 01:02:43.557
Make sure your man double-bags.

01:02:43.642 --> 01:02:45.893
Last time, the bottom near came out.

01:02:45.977 --> 01:02:49.271
Make sure you double-bag, like the lady says.
Understand?

01:02:49.356 --> 01:02:50.815
Yes, sir. I surely will.

01:02:50.899 --> 01:02:54.694
I don't think
the store manager likes me very much.

01:02:57.656 --> 01:03:02.451
Sometimes, after work,
I go to the park and feed the birds.

01:03:02.536 --> 01:03:07.873
I keep thinking Jake might just show up
and say hello.

01:03:07.958 --> 01:03:09.750
But he never does.

01:03:10.836 --> 01:03:16.215
And I hope, wherever he is,
he's doing OK and making new friends.

01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:22.638
I have trouble sleeping at night.

01:03:22.723 --> 01:03:25.516
I have bad dreams, like I'm falling.

01:03:26.601 --> 01:03:28.519
I wake up, scared.

01:03:28.603 --> 01:03:32.606
Sometimes it takes me a while
to remember where I am.

01:03:34.234 --> 01:03:35.693
Maybe I should get me a gun

01:03:35.777 --> 01:03:39.656
and rob the Foodway, so they'd send me home.

01:03:39.741 --> 01:03:42.075
I could shoot the manager, while I was at it.

01:03:42.160 --> 01:03:44.119
Sort of like a bonus.

01:03:45.621 --> 01:03:49.875
I guess I'm too old for that sort of nonsense
any more.

01:03:49.959 --> 01:03:52.002
I don't like it here.

01:03:52.086 --> 01:03:54.755
I'm tired of being afraid all the time.

01:03:54.839 --> 01:03:55.922
I've decided...

01:03:56.007 --> 01:03:57.883
not to stay.

01:04:09.228 --> 01:04:12.731
I doubt they'll kick up any fuss.

01:04:12.815 --> 01:04:14.900
Not for an old crook like me.

01:05:17.923 --> 01:05:21.968
"I doubt they'll kick up any fuss.
Not for an old crook like me.

01:05:23.136 --> 01:05:27.181
PS. Tell Heywood
I'm sorry I put a knife to his throat.

01:05:27.182 --> 01:05:29.267
No hard feelings. Brooks."

01:05:39.988 --> 01:05:42.072
He should have died in here.

01:05:47.495 --> 01:05:51.957
What the fuck have you done?
It's a goddamn mess. I'll tell you that.

01:05:56.671 --> 01:05:58.088
What's all this?

01:05:58.172 --> 01:06:02.050
You tell me, fuck-stick.
They're all addressed to you.

01:06:02.135 --> 01:06:03.427
Take it.

01:06:12.395 --> 01:06:13.979
"Dear Mr. Dufresne...

01:06:15.064 --> 01:06:17.065
In response to your repeated enquiries,

01:06:17.150 --> 01:06:21.862
the State has allocated the enclosed funds
for your library project."

01:06:21.946 --> 01:06:23.322
This is 200 dollars.

01:06:24.365 --> 01:06:28.285
"In addition, the Library District
has generously responded

01:06:28.369 --> 01:06:31.079
with a charitable donation
of used books and sundries.

01:06:31.164 --> 01:06:33.248
We trust this will fill your needs.

01:06:33.333 --> 01:06:37.462
We now consider the matter closed.
Please stop sending us letters."

01:06:37.546 --> 01:06:40.381
I want all this cleared out
before the Warden gets back.

01:06:40.466 --> 01:06:42.133
Yes, sir.

01:06:45.888 --> 01:06:47.263
Good for you, Andy.

01:06:49.892 --> 01:06:51.351
Wow!

01:06:52.436 --> 01:06:54.520
It only took six years.

01:06:55.814 --> 01:06:58.691
From now on,
I'll write two letters a week, instead of one.

01:06:58.776 --> 01:07:02.320
Oh, I believe you're crazy enough.
You'd better get all this stuff out,

01:07:02.404 --> 01:07:03.571
like the Captain said.

01:07:03.656 --> 01:07:07.533
Now, I'm gonna go pinch a loaf.
When I come back, this is all gone, right?

01:07:13.707 --> 01:07:15.708
Wow.

01:07:45.782 --> 01:07:48.492
Duettino from The Marriage Of Figaro

01:07:49.953 --> 01:07:52.538
Sull'aria...

01:07:56.167 --> 01:07:57.167
Andy,

01:07:57.252 --> 01:07:58.585
do you hear that?

01:07:58.670 --> 01:08:02.381
#..zeffiretto

01:08:14.602 --> 01:08:22.443
Questa será spirera

01:08:52.850 --> 01:08:57.145
Sotto i pini

01:08:57.229 --> 01:09:02.442
Del boschetto

01:09:03.944 --> 01:09:06.321
Sotto i pini...

01:09:06.405 --> 01:09:09.282
Dufresne?

01:09:09.366 --> 01:09:10.950
Dufresne?

01:09:11.035 --> 01:09:13.119
Andy, let me out.

01:09:15.831 --> 01:09:19.375
Andy?

01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:24.631
I have no idea to this day
what those two Italian ladies were singing about.

01:09:24.715 --> 01:09:27.133
The truth is, I don't want to know.

01:09:27.218 --> 01:09:29.303
Some things are best left unsaid.

01:09:33.350 --> 01:09:38.395
I like to think they were singing about something
so beautiful, it can't be expressed in words...

01:09:38.480 --> 01:09:40.856
and makes your heart ache because of it.

01:09:43.068 --> 01:09:45.778
I tell you, those voices soared...

01:09:45.862 --> 01:09:50.407
higher and farther
than anybody in a grey place dares to dream.

01:09:50.492 --> 01:09:53.869
It was like some beautiful bird
flapped into our drab little cage

01:09:53.954 --> 01:09:57.081
and made those walls dissolve away.

01:09:57.165 --> 01:09:59.500
And for the briefest of moments...

01:09:59.584 --> 01:10:02.670
every last man at Shawshank felt free.

01:10:05.173 --> 01:10:07.675
It pissed the Warden off something awful.

01:10:09.094 --> 01:10:10.219
Open the door.

01:10:12.973 --> 01:10:14.890
Open it up!

01:10:16.101 --> 01:10:18.477
Dufresne, open this door!

01:10:20.105 --> 01:10:21.438
Turn that off!

01:10:28.239 --> 01:10:30.991
I am warning you, Dufresne. Turn that off!

01:10:44.839 --> 01:10:46.715
Dufresne...

01:10:47.842 --> 01:10:49.926
You're mine now.

01:10:57.476 --> 01:11:00.228
Andy got two weeks in the hole
for that little stunt.

01:11:00.313 --> 01:11:02.731
On your feet!

01:11:03.941 --> 01:11:06.026
- Hey, look who's here.
- Maestro!

01:11:07.528 --> 01:11:11.573
Y- Y-You couldn't play something good, huh?
Hank Williams or something?

01:11:11.657 --> 01:11:14.326
They broke the door down
before I could take requests.

01:11:14.410 --> 01:11:16.203
Was it worth it, two weeks in the hole?

01:11:16.287 --> 01:11:17.537
Easiest time I ever did.

01:11:17.622 --> 01:11:20.665
Bullshit!
There's no such thing as easy time in the hole.

01:11:20.666 --> 01:11:23.293
A week in the hole is like a year.

01:11:23.377 --> 01:11:26.088
I had Mr. Mozart to keep me company.

01:11:26.173 --> 01:11:29.508
So, they let you tote that record player
down there, huh?

01:11:31.637 --> 01:11:33.262
It was in here.

01:11:33.347 --> 01:11:35.014
And in here.

01:11:36.225 --> 01:11:40.478
That's the beauty of music.
They can't get that from you.

01:11:44.399 --> 01:11:46.901
Haven't you ever felt that way about music?

01:11:48.570 --> 01:11:52.657
Well, I played a mean harmonica,
as a younger man.

01:11:52.741 --> 01:11:54.533
Lost interest in it, though.

01:11:54.618 --> 01:11:56.452
Didn't make much sense in here.

01:11:56.536 --> 01:11:58.996
Here's where it makes the most sense.

01:11:59.081 --> 01:12:01.666
You need it, so you don't forget.

01:12:01.750 --> 01:12:03.084
Forget?

01:12:03.168 --> 01:12:05.127
Forget that...

01:12:05.212 --> 01:12:07.296
there are places...

01:12:08.632 --> 01:12:11.175
..in the world that aren't made out of stone...

01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:13.302
that there's a...

01:12:13.387 --> 01:12:15.221
there's something...

01:12:15.305 --> 01:12:18.099
inside that they can't get to...

01:12:18.183 --> 01:12:20.476
that they can't touch.

01:12:20.560 --> 01:12:22.437
It's yours.

01:12:23.856 --> 01:12:25.565
What are you talking about?

01:12:26.651 --> 01:12:28.235
Hope.

01:12:28.319 --> 01:12:30.195
Hope?

01:12:32.031 --> 01:12:34.700
Let me tell you something, my friend.

01:12:34.784 --> 01:12:36.743
Hope is a dangerous thing.

01:12:38.329 --> 01:12:40.372
Hope can drive a man insane.

01:12:41.416 --> 01:12:43.333
It's got no use on the inside.

01:12:43.418 --> 01:12:46.086
You'd better get used to that idea.

01:12:48.506 --> 01:12:50.132
Like Brooks did?

01:13:15.366 --> 01:13:16.408
Sit down.

01:13:21.623 --> 01:13:25.084
It says here that you've served
30 years of a life sentence.

01:13:25.169 --> 01:13:27.795
You feel you've been rehabilitated?

01:13:27.880 --> 01:13:29.964
Oh, yes, sir.

01:13:29.965 --> 01:13:32.050
Without a doubt.

01:13:33.093 --> 01:13:35.428
And I can honestly say I'm a changed man.

01:13:38.015 --> 01:13:40.058
No danger to society here.

01:13:40.142 --> 01:13:42.226
God's honest truth.

01:13:44.563 --> 01:13:46.647
Absolutely rehabilitated.

01:13:56.575 --> 01:13:58.659
30 years.

01:13:59.745 --> 01:14:01.788
Jesus, when they say it like that...

01:14:01.872 --> 01:14:03.956
You wonder where it went.

01:14:06.919 --> 01:14:09.003
I wonder where ten years went.

01:14:14.051 --> 01:14:15.343
Here.

01:14:15.427 --> 01:14:17.595
Little parole rejection present.

01:14:19.432 --> 01:14:21.475
Go ahead and open it.

01:14:21.559 --> 01:14:25.354
I had to go through one of your competitors.
I hope you don't mind.

01:14:25.438 --> 01:14:27.523
I wanted it to be a surprise.

01:14:37.659 --> 01:14:39.743
It's very pretty, Andy.

01:14:40.829 --> 01:14:42.913
Thank you.

01:14:44.666 --> 01:14:46.750
Are you going to play it?

01:14:50.880 --> 01:14:52.965
No.

01:14:55.260 --> 01:14:57.344
Not right now.

01:15:04.602 --> 01:15:06.687
Tier 3 South. Clear.

01:15:07.730 --> 01:15:09.773
Tier 4 North. Clear.

01:15:09.858 --> 01:15:11.942
Tier 1 South. Clear.

01:15:14.779 --> 01:15:16.865
Fall in!

01:15:51.442 --> 01:15:53.026
Lights out!

01:16:27.938 --> 01:16:29.980
Andy was as good as his word.

01:16:30.065 --> 01:16:32.566
He wrote two letters a week instead of one.

01:16:35.195 --> 01:16:39.323
In 1959, the State Senate
finally clued into the fact

01:16:39.407 --> 01:16:42.284
they couldn't buy him off
with just a $200 check.

01:16:42.369 --> 01:16:48.958
Appropriations Committee voted
an annual payment of $500 just to shut him up.

01:16:49.042 --> 01:16:50.751
And you'd be amazed

01:16:50.835 --> 01:16:52.503
how far Andy could stretch it.

01:16:52.587 --> 01:16:55.464
He made deals with book clubs, charity groups.

01:16:55.549 --> 01:16:57.925
He bought remaindered books by the pound.

01:16:58.009 --> 01:17:00.219
Treasure Island.

01:17:00.303 --> 01:17:02.471
Robert Louis...

01:17:02.556 --> 01:17:03.764
..Stevenson.

01:17:03.848 --> 01:17:05.307
Fiction, adventure.

01:17:07.310 --> 01:17:08.936
What's next?

01:17:08.937 --> 01:17:11.647
I got here Auto Repair and...

01:17:12.692 --> 01:17:14.025
..Soap Carving.

01:17:14.110 --> 01:17:17.487
Trade skills and hobbies. Goes under
Educational. The stack behind you.

01:17:17.572 --> 01:17:19.614
The Count Of Monte Crisco.

01:17:19.699 --> 01:17:22.033
That's Cristo, you dumb shit.

01:17:22.118 --> 01:17:25.912
By Alexandree...Dumass.

01:17:25.997 --> 01:17:30.917
Dumb-ass?

01:17:33.421 --> 01:17:35.755
Dumas. You know what that's about?

01:17:35.840 --> 01:17:37.215
Uh-uh.

01:17:37.300 --> 01:17:40.010
You'll like it. It's about a prison break.

01:17:40.094 --> 01:17:44.097
We ought to file that under Educational, too,
oughtn't we?

01:17:44.181 --> 01:17:48.351
The rest of us did our best to pitch in
when and where we could.

01:17:49.604 --> 01:17:51.438
By the year Kennedy was shot,

01:17:51.522 --> 01:17:55.859
Andy had transformed a storage room
smelling of rat turds and turpentine

01:17:55.860 --> 01:17:59.195
into the best prison library in New England,

01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:03.158
complete with a fine selection of Hank Williams.

01:18:03.242 --> 01:18:07.412
Lawd I don't know what I'll do-ooo

01:18:07.496 --> 01:18:10.248
All I do is sit and sigh...

01:18:10.333 --> 01:18:15.087
That was also the year Warden Norton
instituted his famous Inside Out program.

01:18:15.172 --> 01:18:17.882
You may remember reading about it.

01:18:17.966 --> 01:18:21.385
It made all the papers
and got his picture in Look Magazine.

01:18:21.470 --> 01:18:23.137
No free ride.

01:18:23.221 --> 01:18:26.182
But rather a genuine, progressive advance

01:18:26.266 --> 01:18:28.434
in corrections and rehabilitation.

01:18:29.478 --> 01:18:31.812
Our inmates, properly supervised,

01:18:31.897 --> 01:18:34.649
will be put to work outside these walls,

01:18:34.733 --> 01:18:36.817
performing all manner of public service.

01:18:36.902 --> 01:18:40.821
These men can learn
the value of an honest day's labor,

01:18:40.906 --> 01:18:44.575
while providing a valuable service
to the community and...

01:18:44.660 --> 01:18:49.872
at a bare minimum of expense
to Mr. and Mrs. John Q Taxpayer.

01:18:49.956 --> 01:18:52.625
Of course,
Norton failed to mention to the press

01:18:52.709 --> 01:18:56.003
that "bare minimum of expense"
is a fairly loose term.

01:18:56.088 --> 01:18:59.256
There are a hundred different ways
to skim off the top.

01:18:59.341 --> 01:19:01.967
Men, materials, you name it.

01:19:03.011 --> 01:19:05.763
And, oh, my Lord, how the money rolled in.

01:19:05.847 --> 01:19:07.973
If this keeps up, you'll put me out of business.

01:19:08.058 --> 01:19:10.227
- Ned!
- This pool of slave labor you've got,

01:19:10.311 --> 01:19:12.354
you can underbid any contractor in town.

01:19:12.438 --> 01:19:16.400
Ned, we're providing
a valuable community service here.

01:19:16.484 --> 01:19:18.735
Well, that's fine for the papers

01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:20.320
but I've got a family to feed.

01:19:20.405 --> 01:19:22.114
Sam...

01:19:22.198 --> 01:19:24.658
Sam, we go back a long way.

01:19:24.742 --> 01:19:27.077
I need this new highway contract.

01:19:27.161 --> 01:19:29.371
I don't get it, and I go under.

01:19:29.455 --> 01:19:31.498
That's a fact.

01:19:31.582 --> 01:19:33.667
You just have some of this fine pie

01:19:33.751 --> 01:19:35.794
my missus made especially for you,

01:19:35.878 --> 01:19:37.212
and you think about that.

01:19:45.263 --> 01:19:48.181
Ned, I wouldn't worry too much
about this contract.

01:19:48.266 --> 01:19:51.476
It seems to me I already got
my boys committed elsewhere.

01:19:53.354 --> 01:19:55.939
You be sure and thank Maisie for this fine pie.

01:19:57.567 --> 01:19:59.735
And behind every shady deal,

01:19:59.819 --> 01:20:02.028
behind every dollar earned,

01:20:02.113 --> 01:20:05.282
there was Andy, keeping the books.

01:20:06.325 --> 01:20:09.746
Two deposits.
Maine National and New England First.

01:20:09.830 --> 01:20:11.914
Night drops as always, sir.

01:20:42.321 --> 01:20:44.071
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

01:20:44.156 --> 01:20:46.949
- Two suits for dry-clean and a bag of whatnot.
- Yes, sir.

01:20:47.034 --> 01:20:50.787
Tell them if they over-starch my shirts again,
they'll hear about it from me.

01:20:50.871 --> 01:20:52.872
How do I look?

01:20:52.956 --> 01:20:55.666
- Very nice, sir.
- Big charity to-do up Portland way.

01:20:55.751 --> 01:20:57.460
The Governor's going to be there.

01:20:58.879 --> 01:21:00.922
Want the rest of this?

01:21:01.006 --> 01:21:03.090
The woman can't bake worth shit.

01:21:04.468 --> 01:21:06.261
Thank you, sir.

01:21:08.431 --> 01:21:12.184
- He's got his fingers in a lot of pies, I hear.
- What you hear isn't half of it.

01:21:12.268 --> 01:21:14.728
He's got scams you haven't even dreamed of.

01:21:14.813 --> 01:21:16.855
Kickbacks on his kickbacks.

01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:19.817
There's a river of dirty money
running through this place.

01:21:19.901 --> 01:21:23.153
But the problem with having all that money
is you'll have to explain

01:21:23.238 --> 01:21:25.823
- where it came from.
- That's where I come in.

01:21:25.907 --> 01:21:28.408
I channel it, filter it, funnel it.

01:21:28.493 --> 01:21:31.036
Stocks, securities, tax-free municipals.

01:21:31.120 --> 01:21:33.789
I send that money out into the real world.

01:21:33.873 --> 01:21:37.501
- And when it comes back...
- Clean as a virgin's honey pot, huh?

01:21:37.585 --> 01:21:38.794
Cleaner.

01:21:38.878 --> 01:21:42.506
By the time Norton retires,
I'll have made him a millionaire.

01:21:45.260 --> 01:21:49.680
If they ever catch on, though, he's gonna
wind up in here wearing a number himself.

01:21:49.764 --> 01:21:53.016
Now, Red, I thought you had
a little more faith in me than that.

01:21:53.101 --> 01:21:56.395
I know you're good, Andy,
but all that paper leaves a trail.

01:21:56.479 --> 01:21:59.481
Now, anybody gets curious,
the FBI, the IRS, whatever,

01:21:59.566 --> 01:22:02.401
it's gonna lead to somebody.

01:22:02.485 --> 01:22:04.445
Sure it is. But not to me.

01:22:04.530 --> 01:22:06.531
And certainly not to the Warden.

01:22:10.578 --> 01:22:11.870
All right. Who?

01:22:11.954 --> 01:22:13.663
Randall Stevens.

01:22:13.747 --> 01:22:14.914
Who?

01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:20.712
The silent silent partner. He's the guilty one,
Your Honor. The man with the bank accounts.

01:22:20.796 --> 01:22:22.964
That's where the filtering process starts.

01:22:23.048 --> 01:22:26.217
If they trace anything,
it's just going to lead to him.

01:22:26.302 --> 01:22:27.886
But who is he?

01:22:27.970 --> 01:22:30.013
He's a phantom, an apparition.

01:22:30.097 --> 01:22:32.056
Second cousin to Harvey the Rabbit.

01:22:32.141 --> 01:22:34.309
I conjured him...

01:22:34.393 --> 01:22:36.436
out of thin air.

01:22:36.520 --> 01:22:39.355
He doesn't exist, except on paper.

01:22:42.484 --> 01:22:44.861
Andy, you can't just make a person up.

01:22:44.945 --> 01:22:48.072
Sure you can, if you know how
the system works, where the cracks are.

01:22:48.157 --> 01:22:51.659
It's amazing what you can accomplish by mail.

01:22:51.744 --> 01:22:54.370
Mr. Stevens has a birth certificate,

01:22:54.455 --> 01:22:56.789
a driver's license, social security number.

01:22:56.874 --> 01:22:58.082
You're shitting me?

01:22:58.167 --> 01:23:00.126
If they ever trace any of those accounts,

01:23:00.210 --> 01:23:03.088
they're going to wind up chasing
a figment of my imagination.

01:23:03.173 --> 01:23:05.257
Well, I'll be damned.

01:23:06.551 --> 01:23:08.594
Did I say you were good?

01:23:08.678 --> 01:23:10.846
Shit, you're a Rembrandt!

01:23:10.931 --> 01:23:12.973
You know, the funny thing is,

01:23:13.058 --> 01:23:17.019
on the outside, I was an honest man,
straight as an arrow.

01:23:18.063 --> 01:23:20.439
I had to come to prison to be a crook.

01:23:29.199 --> 01:23:30.574
Ever bother you?

01:23:31.618 --> 01:23:35.037
I don't run the scams, Red,
I just process the profits.

01:23:35.121 --> 01:23:37.164
Fine line maybe but...

01:23:37.248 --> 01:23:39.959
I also built that library

01:23:40.043 --> 01:23:42.670
and used it to help a dozen guys
get a high school diploma.

01:23:42.754 --> 01:23:44.630
Why do you think the Warden lets me do it?

01:23:44.714 --> 01:23:47.466
To keep you happy and doing the laundry.

01:23:47.550 --> 01:23:49.677
Money instead of sheets.

01:23:49.761 --> 01:23:52.471
Well, I work cheap. That's the trade-off.

01:23:58.061 --> 01:24:00.271
Willy And The Hand Jive

01:24:08.072 --> 01:24:09.864
I know a cat named...

01:24:09.949 --> 01:24:12.617
Tommy Williams
came to Shawshank in 1965

01:24:12.702 --> 01:24:14.744
on a two-year stretch for B&E.

01:24:14.829 --> 01:24:16.955
That's breaking and entering to you.

01:24:17.039 --> 01:24:21.668
The cops caught him sneaking TV sets
out the back door of a JC Penney.

01:24:21.752 --> 01:24:23.503
Young punk.

01:24:23.587 --> 01:24:25.630
Mr. Rock'n'roll.

01:24:25.715 --> 01:24:27.382
Cocky as hell.

01:24:27.466 --> 01:24:30.051
Hey, come on, old boys! Moving like molasses!

01:24:30.136 --> 01:24:32.095
Making me look bad.

01:24:32.096 --> 01:24:34.055
We liked him immediately.

01:24:34.140 --> 01:24:36.182
So I'm backing out the door, right?

01:24:36.267 --> 01:24:37.976
And I got the TV like this.

01:24:38.060 --> 01:24:41.896
It was a big old thing. I couldn't see shit.
Suddenly, I hears this voice.

01:24:41.981 --> 01:24:44.024
"Freeze, kid! Hands in the air."

01:24:44.108 --> 01:24:45.775
Well, I just stand there,

01:24:45.860 --> 01:24:48.653
holding onto that TV. So, finally, the voice says,

01:24:48.738 --> 01:24:50.697
"Do you hear what I said, boy?"

01:24:50.781 --> 01:24:53.158
I say, "Yes, sir, I sure did.

01:24:53.242 --> 01:24:56.870
But if I drop this fucking thing,
you got me on destruction of property, too."

01:25:00.959 --> 01:25:03.669
Hey, you've done a stretch in Cashman, right?

01:25:03.754 --> 01:25:07.590
Yeah. Yeah, that was an easy piece of time,
let me tell you.

01:25:07.674 --> 01:25:10.301
Weekend furloughs, work programs.

01:25:10.385 --> 01:25:11.802
Not like here.

01:25:11.887 --> 01:25:14.221
Sounds like you done time
all over New England.

01:25:14.306 --> 01:25:19.393
Yeah, I've been in and out since I was 13. You
name the place, chances are I've been there.

01:25:19.478 --> 01:25:23.481
Perhaps it's time you tried a new profession?

01:25:23.565 --> 01:25:28.652
What I mean is, you don't seem to be a good
thief. Maybe you should try something else.

01:25:28.737 --> 01:25:32.573
Yeah, well, what the hell
do you know about it, Capone?

01:25:32.657 --> 01:25:34.408
What are you in for?

01:25:34.493 --> 01:25:36.118
Me?

01:25:37.621 --> 01:25:39.705
The lawyer fucked me.

01:25:43.418 --> 01:25:46.837
Everybody's innocent in here.
Don't you know that?

01:25:54.304 --> 01:25:58.475
As it turned out, Tommy had himself
a young wife and a new baby girl.

01:25:59.519 --> 01:26:04.648
Maybe it was the thought of them on the streets
or his child growing up not knowing her daddy.

01:26:04.732 --> 01:26:08.568
Whatever it was,
something lit a fire under that boy's ass.

01:26:12.532 --> 01:26:15.784
I was thinking of maybe
trying for my high school equivalency.

01:26:15.868 --> 01:26:18.453
I hear you helped a couple of fellas with that.

01:26:19.664 --> 01:26:21.873
I don't waste time on losers, Tommy.

01:26:23.459 --> 01:26:25.544
I ain't no goddamn loser.

01:26:27.380 --> 01:26:29.464
- You mean that?
- Yeah.

01:26:31.134 --> 01:26:33.176
You really mean that?

01:26:33.261 --> 01:26:34.928
Yes, sir, I do.

01:26:35.012 --> 01:26:37.139
Good. Because if we do this,

01:26:37.223 --> 01:26:39.975
we do it all the way, 100%, nothing half-assed.

01:26:41.102 --> 01:26:43.186
The thing is, see...

01:26:44.355 --> 01:26:46.189
..I don't read so good.

01:26:47.316 --> 01:26:48.525
Well.

01:26:50.278 --> 01:26:52.320
You don't read...

01:26:52.405 --> 01:26:54.490
so well.

01:26:55.951 --> 01:26:57.618
We'll get to that.

01:26:58.704 --> 01:27:00.454
- R.
- R...

01:27:00.539 --> 01:27:01.914
- S.
- S...

01:27:01.999 --> 01:27:04.167
So Andy took Tommy under his wing.

01:27:04.251 --> 01:27:06.669
He started walking him through his ABCs.

01:27:08.338 --> 01:27:10.923
Tommy took to it pretty well, too.

01:27:11.008 --> 01:27:13.968
The boy found brains he never knew he had.

01:27:16.305 --> 01:27:20.099
Before long, Andy started him
on his course requirements.

01:27:20.184 --> 01:27:22.143
He really liked the kid.

01:27:22.227 --> 01:27:25.396
It gave him a thrill to help a youngster
crawl off the shit heap.

01:27:26.440 --> 01:27:28.482
But that wasn't the only reason.

01:27:28.567 --> 01:27:31.027
Prison time is slow time.

01:27:32.070 --> 01:27:34.322
So you do what you can to keep going.

01:27:34.406 --> 01:27:36.657
Some fellas collect stamps.

01:27:36.658 --> 01:27:39.285
Others build matchstick houses.

01:27:40.329 --> 01:27:42.705
Andy built a library.

01:27:43.749 --> 01:27:45.791
Now he needed a new project.

01:27:45.876 --> 01:27:47.919
Tommy was it.

01:27:48.003 --> 01:27:52.216
It was the same reason he spent years
shaping and polishing those rocks.

01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:55.928
The same reason
he hung his fantasy girlies on the wall.

01:27:57.305 --> 01:27:58.805
In prison,

01:27:58.890 --> 01:28:02.017
a man will do most anything
to keep his mind occupied.

01:28:03.478 --> 01:28:07.940
By 1966, right about the time
Tommy was getting ready to take his exams,

01:28:07.941 --> 01:28:09.983
it was lovely Raquel.

01:28:27.252 --> 01:28:28.293
Time.

01:28:34.300 --> 01:28:35.592
Well?

01:28:36.678 --> 01:28:38.220
Well, it's for shit.

01:28:38.304 --> 01:28:40.806
I wasted a whole fucking year of my time

01:28:40.890 --> 01:28:44.059
- with this bullshit.
- It's probably not as bad as you think.

01:28:44.143 --> 01:28:47.854
It's worse. I didn't get one thing right.
It might as well have been in Chinese.

01:28:47.939 --> 01:28:50.441
Let's see how the score comes out.

01:28:50.526 --> 01:28:53.152
Well, I'll tell you how the goddamn score
comes out.

01:28:54.947 --> 01:28:56.864
Two points right there.

01:28:56.949 --> 01:28:58.741
There's your goddamn score!

01:28:58.826 --> 01:29:02.662
Goddamn cats crawling up trees,
5x5 is 25.

01:29:03.747 --> 01:29:05.290
Fuck this place!

01:29:05.291 --> 01:29:06.582
Fuck it!

01:29:25.394 --> 01:29:28.146
I feel bad. I let him down.

01:29:28.230 --> 01:29:30.315
Ah, that's crap, kid.

01:29:30.316 --> 01:29:31.858
He's proud of you.

01:29:31.942 --> 01:29:35.069
We've been friends a long time
so I know him as good as anybody.

01:29:35.154 --> 01:29:38.031
- A smart fellow, ain't he?
- As smart as they come.

01:29:38.115 --> 01:29:40.158
He used to be a banker on the outside.

01:29:40.242 --> 01:29:42.285
What's he in here for, anyway?

01:29:42.369 --> 01:29:43.870
Murder.

01:29:44.997 --> 01:29:46.748
The hell you say!

01:29:48.877 --> 01:29:51.170
You wouldn't think it to look at the guy.

01:29:52.213 --> 01:29:54.673
He caught his wife in bed with some golf pro.

01:29:54.758 --> 01:29:56.842
He greased them both.

01:30:04.726 --> 01:30:06.602
What?

01:30:06.686 --> 01:30:09.063
About four years ago,

01:30:09.147 --> 01:30:12.232
I was in Thomaston on a two-to-three stretch.

01:30:13.485 --> 01:30:16.570
I stole a car. It was a dumb-fuck thing to do.

01:30:17.864 --> 01:30:19.907
About six months left to go,

01:30:19.991 --> 01:30:22.034
I get a new cellmate in.

01:30:22.118 --> 01:30:23.994
Elmo Blatch.

01:30:25.038 --> 01:30:26.622
Big, twitchy fucker.

01:30:26.623 --> 01:30:28.916
Kind of roomie you pray you don't get.

01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:31.043
You know what I'm saying?

01:30:31.127 --> 01:30:33.170
Six-to-twelve, armed burglary.

01:30:33.254 --> 01:30:36.465
He said he'd pulled hundreds of jobs.

01:30:36.549 --> 01:30:38.425
Hard to believe, high-strung as he was.

01:30:38.510 --> 01:30:41.512
You'd cut a loud fart,
he'd jump three feet in the air.

01:30:42.639 --> 01:30:44.681
Talked all the time, too.

01:30:44.766 --> 01:30:47.102
That's the other thing. He never shut up.

01:30:47.186 --> 01:30:49.229
Places he'd been in,

01:30:49.313 --> 01:30:51.981
jobs he'd pulled, women he'd fucked.

01:30:52.066 --> 01:30:54.484
Even people he'd killed.

01:30:56.320 --> 01:30:58.696
People who gave him shit.

01:30:59.740 --> 01:31:01.783
That's how he put it.

01:31:01.867 --> 01:31:03.410
So...

01:31:03.494 --> 01:31:05.578
one night, like a joke,

01:31:06.622 --> 01:31:09.916
I say to him, I say,
"Yeah, Elmo, who did you kill?"

01:31:10.000 --> 01:31:11.793
So he says...

01:31:11.877 --> 01:31:15.505
I got me this job one time
bussing tables at a country club.

01:31:16.632 --> 01:31:20.218
So I could case
all these big rich pricks that come in.

01:31:22.638 --> 01:31:24.639
So I pick out this guy,

01:31:25.683 --> 01:31:28.268
go in one night and do his place.

01:31:30.438 --> 01:31:32.439
He wakes up.

01:31:32.523 --> 01:31:34.566
He gives me shit.

01:31:35.609 --> 01:31:37.694
So I killed him.

01:31:38.737 --> 01:31:40.822
Him and this tasty bitch he was with.

01:31:43.117 --> 01:31:45.035
That's the best part.

01:31:46.079 --> 01:31:49.290
She's fucking this prick, see, this golf pro.

01:31:49.374 --> 01:31:51.459
But she's married to some other guy.

01:31:52.502 --> 01:31:54.587
Some hotshot banker.

01:31:56.381 --> 01:31:58.466
And he's the one they pinned it on.

01:32:09.603 --> 01:32:13.439
I have to say
that's the most amazing story I ever heard.

01:32:15.066 --> 01:32:17.943
What amazes me most is
you were taken in by it.

01:32:18.028 --> 01:32:19.653
Sir?

01:32:19.738 --> 01:32:21.405
Well...

01:32:21.490 --> 01:32:24.867
it's obvious this fella Williams
is impressed with you.

01:32:24.951 --> 01:32:27.036
He hears your tale of woe

01:32:27.120 --> 01:32:30.039
and quite naturally wants to cheer you up.

01:32:30.123 --> 01:32:32.166
He's young, not terribly bright.

01:32:32.250 --> 01:32:36.128
Not surprising he wouldn't know
what a state he'd put you in.

01:32:36.213 --> 01:32:38.339
Sir, he's telling the truth.

01:32:38.423 --> 01:32:42.469
Well, let's say, for the moment,
this Blatch does exist.

01:32:42.553 --> 01:32:45.680
You think he'd just fall to his knees and cry,

01:32:45.765 --> 01:32:47.974
"Yes, I did it! I confess!

01:32:48.059 --> 01:32:50.268
And by the way,
add a life term to my sentence"?

01:32:50.353 --> 01:32:53.522
That doesn't matter.
With Tommy's testimony, I can get a new trial.

01:32:53.606 --> 01:32:56.816
That's assuming Blatch is even still there.

01:32:56.901 --> 01:32:58.944
The chances are he'd be released by now.

01:32:59.028 --> 01:33:01.613
They'd have his last address,
names of relatives.

01:33:01.697 --> 01:33:03.865
There's a chance, isn't there?

01:33:05.910 --> 01:33:07.786
How can you be so obtuse?

01:33:07.870 --> 01:33:09.371
What?

01:33:10.873 --> 01:33:12.707
What did you call me?

01:33:12.792 --> 01:33:14.626
Obtuse. Is it deliberate?

01:33:14.710 --> 01:33:16.503
Son, you're forgetting yourself.

01:33:16.587 --> 01:33:19.422
The country club will have his old timecards,

01:33:19.507 --> 01:33:21.633
records, W-2s,

01:33:21.717 --> 01:33:25.720
- with his name on them.
- If you indulge this fantasy, that's your business.

01:33:25.805 --> 01:33:29.766
- Don't make it mine. This meeting is over.
- Sir, if I were to ever get out,

01:33:29.850 --> 01:33:34.854
I would never mention what goes on in here.
I'd be as indictable as you for laundering money.

01:33:36.649 --> 01:33:39.651
Don't ever mention money to me again,
you sorry son of a bitch!

01:33:39.736 --> 01:33:41.612
Not in this office.

01:33:41.613 --> 01:33:43.739
Not anywhere! Get in here now.

01:33:43.824 --> 01:33:47.076
I'm just trying to set your mind at ease,
that's all. Sir, I...

01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:48.536
Solitary. A month.

01:33:48.620 --> 01:33:50.788
- Yes, sir.
- What's the matter with you?

01:33:50.872 --> 01:33:54.125
- Get him out of here.
- This is my chance to get out! Don't you see?

01:33:54.126 --> 01:33:56.127
It's my life! Don't you understand?

01:33:56.211 --> 01:33:58.671
- Get him out! Get him out!
- This is my life!

01:33:58.755 --> 01:34:00.006
No!

01:34:00.090 --> 01:34:01.924
A month in the hole.

01:34:02.009 --> 01:34:04.594
It's the longest damn stretch I ever heard of.

01:34:04.678 --> 01:34:06.470
It's all my fault.

01:34:06.555 --> 01:34:07.972
Oh, bullshit.

01:34:08.056 --> 01:34:11.350
You didn't pull the trigger
and you certainly didn't convict him.

01:34:11.435 --> 01:34:13.811
Red, are you saying that Andy is innocent?

01:34:13.895 --> 01:34:16.063
I mean, for real innocent?

01:34:16.148 --> 01:34:18.190
It looks that way.

01:34:18.275 --> 01:34:20.318
Sweet Jesus.

01:34:20.402 --> 01:34:22.445
How long's he been here now?

01:34:22.529 --> 01:34:24.572
1947. What is that?

01:34:24.656 --> 01:34:26.198
- 19 years.
19 years...

01:34:26.283 --> 01:34:28.909
Williams, Thomas.
- Yeah, over here.

01:34:31.288 --> 01:34:33.539
- Paxon, Edward.
- Yeah.

01:34:34.750 --> 01:34:37.668
What you got? Board of Education.

01:34:37.753 --> 01:34:40.422
- The son of a bitch mailed it.
- Looks like he did.

01:34:40.506 --> 01:34:43.550
Are you gonna open it or stand there
with your thumb up your butt?

01:34:43.635 --> 01:34:45.719
The thumb up my butt sounds better.

01:34:46.763 --> 01:34:49.514
Hey, Skeet, come on,
give me that, you shithead.

01:34:50.558 --> 01:34:52.768
- Floyd, come on.
- Over here, over here!

01:34:53.811 --> 01:34:55.896
Hey, Red!

01:34:57.023 --> 01:34:59.441
Come on, will you throw that away, please?

01:35:05.031 --> 01:35:07.115
Well, shit.

01:35:19.337 --> 01:35:22.047
The kid passed. C+ average.

01:35:22.131 --> 01:35:24.216
Thought you'd like to know.

01:35:40.776 --> 01:35:42.860
The Warden wants to talk.

01:35:56.250 --> 01:35:57.375
Out here?

01:35:57.459 --> 01:35:59.544
That's what the man said.

01:36:15.853 --> 01:36:17.645
Warden?

01:36:17.730 --> 01:36:19.814
Tommy.

01:36:25.279 --> 01:36:26.738
Tommy...

01:36:26.822 --> 01:36:30.908
I'm asking you to keep this conversation
just between us.

01:36:32.327 --> 01:36:34.413
I feel awkward enough as it is.

01:36:52.891 --> 01:36:54.975
We got a situation here.

01:36:56.019 --> 01:36:58.061
I think you can appreciate that.

01:36:58.146 --> 01:36:59.605
Yes, sir.

01:36:59.689 --> 01:37:01.190
I sure can.

01:37:01.274 --> 01:37:05.319
I tell you, son, this thing really came along
and knocked my wind out.

01:37:07.030 --> 01:37:09.573
It's got me up nights, that's the truth.

01:37:11.785 --> 01:37:13.869
The right thing to do.

01:37:15.205 --> 01:37:18.207
Sometimes it's hard to know what that is.

01:37:19.918 --> 01:37:21.960
You understand?

01:37:23.338 --> 01:37:25.422
I need your help, son.

01:37:26.841 --> 01:37:28.926
If I'm going to move on this,

01:37:28.927 --> 01:37:31.678
there can't be the least little shred of doubt.

01:37:33.224 --> 01:37:36.643
I have to know
if what you told Dufresne was the truth.

01:37:36.727 --> 01:37:38.311
Yes, sir.

01:37:38.312 --> 01:37:39.938
Absolutely.

01:37:40.022 --> 01:37:43.107
Would you be willing
to swear before a judge and jury,

01:37:43.192 --> 01:37:45.610
having placed your hand on the Good Book

01:37:45.611 --> 01:37:48.321
and taken an oath before Almighty God himself?

01:37:48.405 --> 01:37:50.532
Just give me that chance.

01:37:54.453 --> 01:37:56.120
That's what I thought.

01:38:43.211 --> 01:38:45.296
I'm sure by now you've heard...

01:38:46.548 --> 01:38:47.923
A terrible thing.

01:38:49.384 --> 01:38:52.970
A man that young, less than a year to go,
trying to escape.

01:38:54.055 --> 01:38:56.682
It broke Captain Hadley's heart to shoot him.

01:38:57.726 --> 01:38:59.810
Truly, it did.

01:39:01.855 --> 01:39:03.939
We just have to put it behind us.

01:39:06.109 --> 01:39:07.526
Move on.

01:39:08.987 --> 01:39:10.863
I'm done.

01:39:11.907 --> 01:39:13.991
Everything stops.

01:39:15.035 --> 01:39:17.870
Get someone else to run your scams.

01:39:19.205 --> 01:39:21.290
Nothing stops.

01:39:22.334 --> 01:39:24.418
Nothing.

01:39:26.171 --> 01:39:28.256
Or you will do the hardest time there is.

01:39:30.134 --> 01:39:32.719
No more protection from the guards.

01:39:32.803 --> 01:39:35.138
I'll pull you out of that one-bunk Hilton

01:39:35.222 --> 01:39:37.390
and cast you down with the Sodomites.

01:39:39.143 --> 01:39:41.645
You'll think you've been fucked by a train.

01:39:42.939 --> 01:39:44.981
And the library?

01:39:45.066 --> 01:39:46.191
Gone.

01:39:46.275 --> 01:39:48.652
Sealed off, brick by brick.

01:39:49.695 --> 01:39:52.489
We'll have us a little book barbecue in the yard.

01:39:52.573 --> 01:39:54.616
They'll see the flames for miles.

01:39:54.700 --> 01:39:57.202
We'll dance around it like wild Injuns.

01:39:58.788 --> 01:40:00.705
You understand me?

01:40:00.790 --> 01:40:02.874
Catching my drift?

01:40:05.962 --> 01:40:08.046
Or am I being obtuse?

01:40:19.183 --> 01:40:21.309
Give him another month to think about it.

01:41:08.900 --> 01:41:11.944
My wife used to say I'm a hard man to know.

01:41:12.029 --> 01:41:14.113
Like a closed book.

01:41:15.323 --> 01:41:18.075
Complained about it all the time.

01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:20.244
She was beautiful.

01:41:22.456 --> 01:41:24.541
God, I loved her.

01:41:27.545 --> 01:41:29.880
I just didn't know how to show it, that's all.

01:41:32.383 --> 01:41:34.468
I killed her, Red.

01:41:35.928 --> 01:41:38.013
I didn't pull the trigger.

01:41:39.432 --> 01:41:41.516
But I drove her away.

01:41:42.727 --> 01:41:45.270
That's why she died, because of me.

01:41:45.354 --> 01:41:47.439
The way I am.

01:41:55.782 --> 01:41:57.866
That don't make you a murderer.

01:42:01.079 --> 01:42:03.163
A bad husband, maybe.

01:42:06.542 --> 01:42:09.920
Feel bad about it if you want to,
but you didn't pull the trigger.

01:42:10.004 --> 01:42:11.421
No, I didn't.

01:42:11.506 --> 01:42:13.548
Somebody else did.

01:42:14.842 --> 01:42:16.927
And I wound up in here.

01:42:19.305 --> 01:42:21.389
Bad luck, I guess.

01:42:24.311 --> 01:42:26.020
Yeah.

01:42:26.105 --> 01:42:28.397
It floats around.

01:42:28.482 --> 01:42:30.942
It's got to land on somebody.

01:42:31.026 --> 01:42:33.277
It was my turn, that's all.

01:42:34.363 --> 01:42:36.823
I was in the path of the tornado.

01:42:43.413 --> 01:42:47.166
I just didn't expect
the storm would last as long as it has.

01:42:51.255 --> 01:42:53.172
Do you think you'll ever get out of here?

01:42:54.424 --> 01:42:56.092
Me?

01:42:58.387 --> 01:42:59.846
Yeah.

01:43:00.889 --> 01:43:02.849
One day, when I've got a long, white beard

01:43:02.933 --> 01:43:06.435
and two or three marbles rolling around upstairs,
they'll let me out.

01:43:08.355 --> 01:43:10.439
I tell you where I'd go.

01:43:11.650 --> 01:43:13.276
Zihuatanejo.

01:43:13.360 --> 01:43:15.278
Zi...what?

01:43:15.362 --> 01:43:17.405
Zihuatanejo.

01:43:17.489 --> 01:43:19.574
It's in Mexico.

01:43:21.369 --> 01:43:23.579
A little place on the Pacific Ocean.

01:43:24.831 --> 01:43:27.207
You know what the Mexicans say
about the Pacific?

01:43:27.292 --> 01:43:28.750
No.

01:43:28.835 --> 01:43:30.919
They say it has no memory.

01:43:33.381 --> 01:43:35.924
That's where I want to live the rest of my life.

01:43:37.510 --> 01:43:39.595
A warm place with no memory.

01:43:42.891 --> 01:43:45.184
Open up a little hotel,

01:43:47.020 --> 01:43:48.896
right on the beach.

01:43:48.980 --> 01:43:51.023
Buy some worthless old boat,

01:43:51.107 --> 01:43:53.192
fix it up new.

01:43:56.154 --> 01:43:57.362
Take my guests out.

01:43:57.447 --> 01:43:59.531
Charter fishing.

01:44:03.453 --> 01:44:06.079
Zihuatanejo, huh?

01:44:08.708 --> 01:44:12.586
In a place like that, I could use a man
who knows how to get things.

01:44:19.011 --> 01:44:21.721
I don't think I could make it on the outside, Andy.

01:44:28.479 --> 01:44:30.563
I've been in here most of my life.

01:44:32.066 --> 01:44:33.858
I'm an institutional man now.

01:44:33.943 --> 01:44:36.027
Just like Brooks was.

01:44:37.446 --> 01:44:39.697
Well, you underestimate yourself.

01:44:39.782 --> 01:44:41.866
I don't think so.

01:44:44.495 --> 01:44:48.706
I mean...in here, I'm the guy
who can get things for you, sure.

01:44:48.791 --> 01:44:52.710
But outside, all you need is the Yellow Pages.

01:44:52.795 --> 01:44:55.213
Hell, I wouldn't even know where to begin.

01:44:57.299 --> 01:44:59.634
The Pacific Ocean?

01:44:59.718 --> 01:45:01.761
Shit.

01:45:01.845 --> 01:45:05.014
- About scare me to death, something that big.
- Not me.

01:45:05.099 --> 01:45:08.559
I didn't shoot my wife and I didn't shoot her lover.

01:45:10.479 --> 01:45:14.107
Whatever mistakes I've made,
I've paid for them and then some.

01:45:14.191 --> 01:45:16.359
That hotel, that boat.

01:45:17.946 --> 01:45:20.114
I don't think that's too much to ask.

01:45:24.744 --> 01:45:27.621
I don't think you ought to be
doing this to yourself, Andy.

01:45:27.706 --> 01:45:29.748
These are just shitty pipe dreams.

01:45:29.833 --> 01:45:32.793
I mean, Mexico is way the hell down there
and you're in here.

01:45:32.877 --> 01:45:34.920
And that's the way it is.

01:45:35.005 --> 01:45:37.631
Yeah, right. That's the way it is.

01:45:39.384 --> 01:45:41.468
It's down there and I'm in here.

01:45:44.180 --> 01:45:46.974
I guess it comes down to a simple choice, really.

01:45:49.811 --> 01:45:51.854
Get busy living

01:45:51.938 --> 01:45:54.857
or get busy dying.

01:45:58.653 --> 01:46:00.738
Andy.

01:46:03.199 --> 01:46:05.284
Red.

01:46:06.328 --> 01:46:08.746
If you ever get out of here, do me a favor.

01:46:08.830 --> 01:46:10.664
Sure, Andy.

01:46:10.749 --> 01:46:12.082
Anything.

01:46:13.168 --> 01:46:16.629
There's a big hayfield up near Buxton.
You know where Buxton is?

01:46:18.632 --> 01:46:22.427
- Well, just... There's a lot of hayfields up there.
- One in particular.

01:46:22.511 --> 01:46:24.554
It's got a long rock wall

01:46:24.638 --> 01:46:26.556
with a big oak tree at the north end.

01:46:26.640 --> 01:46:29.351
It's like something out of a Robert Frost poem.

01:46:30.728 --> 01:46:33.438
It's where I asked my wife to marry me.

01:46:34.648 --> 01:46:38.443
We went there for a picnic
and made love under that oak.

01:46:39.945 --> 01:46:42.030
I asked and she said yes.

01:46:46.160 --> 01:46:48.203
Promise me, Red,

01:46:48.287 --> 01:46:50.288
if you ever get out,

01:46:50.373 --> 01:46:52.415
find that spot.

01:46:53.459 --> 01:46:58.922
At the base of that wall, you'll find a rock that has
no earthly business in a Maine hayfield.

01:46:59.006 --> 01:47:01.508
A piece of black, volcanic glass.

01:47:04.678 --> 01:47:07.472
There's something buried under it
I want you to have.

01:47:07.556 --> 01:47:09.557
What, Andy?

01:47:09.642 --> 01:47:11.726
What's buried under there?

01:47:13.522 --> 01:47:16.899
You'll have to pry it up to see.

01:47:22.239 --> 01:47:24.323
No, I'm telling you, the guy is...

01:47:25.367 --> 01:47:27.451
He's talking funnier.

01:47:27.536 --> 01:47:30.913
- I'm really worried about him.
- We ought to keep an eye on him.

01:47:30.997 --> 01:47:35.042
That's fine during the day,
but at night he's got that cell all to himself.

01:47:36.128 --> 01:47:37.586
Oh, Lord.

01:47:37.671 --> 01:47:39.713
What?

01:47:41.383 --> 01:47:43.717
Andy come down to the loading dock today.

01:47:43.802 --> 01:47:47.304
- He asked me for a length of rope.
- Rope?

01:47:47.389 --> 01:47:49.223
Six feet long.

01:47:49.307 --> 01:47:50.766
And you gave it to him?

01:47:50.851 --> 01:47:53.519
Sure I did. Why wouldn't I?

01:47:53.520 --> 01:47:55.229
Jesus, Heywood.

01:47:55.313 --> 01:47:57.565
Hey, how the hell was I supposed to know?

01:47:57.649 --> 01:47:59.567
Remember Brooks Hatlen?

01:47:59.651 --> 01:48:00.693
No.

01:48:01.736 --> 01:48:03.946
Andy would never do that.

01:48:03.947 --> 01:48:06.031
Never.

01:48:07.075 --> 01:48:09.160
I don't know.

01:48:11.205 --> 01:48:13.290
Every man has his breaking point.

01:48:15.918 --> 01:48:17.169
Lickety-split.

01:48:17.253 --> 01:48:20.130
- I want to get home.
- Just about finished, sir.

01:48:36.230 --> 01:48:38.315
Three deposits tonight.

01:48:46.699 --> 01:48:48.783
Get my stuff down to the laundry.

01:48:48.784 --> 01:48:52.245
And shine my shoes.
I want 'em looking like mirrors.

01:48:52.330 --> 01:48:53.705
Yes, sir.

01:48:59.003 --> 01:49:00.670
It's good having you back, Andy.

01:49:00.755 --> 01:49:03.507
The place wasn't the same without you.

01:49:50.556 --> 01:49:53.307
Lights out!

01:50:24.048 --> 01:50:26.341
I've had some long nights in stir.

01:50:27.385 --> 01:50:30.095
Alone in the dark with nothing but your thoughts,

01:50:30.179 --> 01:50:32.014
time can draw out like a blade.

01:50:38.396 --> 01:50:40.731
That was the longest night of my life.

01:50:56.873 --> 01:50:58.498
Give me a count.

01:51:02.837 --> 01:51:04.880
Tier 3 South. Clear.

01:51:04.964 --> 01:51:06.299
Tier 4 North. Clear.

01:51:06.383 --> 01:51:09.969
- Tier 3 North. Clear.
- Man missing on Tier 2.

01:51:10.054 --> 01:51:13.139
- Cell 245.
- Dufresne.

01:51:13.223 --> 01:51:16.142
Get your ass out here, boy.
You're holding up the show.

01:51:18.646 --> 01:51:22.690
Don't make me come down there.
I'll thump your skull for you.

01:51:30.282 --> 01:51:33.660
Damn it, Dufresne, you're putting me behind!
I got a schedule to keep.

01:51:33.744 --> 01:51:36.829
You'd better be sick or dead in there,
I shit you not!

01:51:36.914 --> 01:51:38.748
You hear me?

01:51:45.255 --> 01:51:47.340
Oh, my holy God.

01:52:04.192 --> 01:52:06.902
I want every man on this cell block questioned.

01:52:06.903 --> 01:52:09.113
- Start with that friend of his.
- Who?

01:52:09.197 --> 01:52:10.406
Him!

01:52:12.325 --> 01:52:14.410
Open 237.

01:52:17.414 --> 01:52:19.540
What do you mean, he just wasn't here?

01:52:19.624 --> 01:52:21.166
Don't say that to me, Haig.

01:52:21.251 --> 01:52:23.502
Don't say that to me again.

01:52:23.586 --> 01:52:24.670
But, sir, he wasn't.

01:52:24.754 --> 01:52:26.922
I can see that, Haig!

01:52:27.006 --> 01:52:28.799
You think I'm blind?

01:52:28.800 --> 01:52:31.927
Is that what you're saying? Am I blind, Haig?

01:52:32.011 --> 01:52:33.011
No, sir.

01:52:33.096 --> 01:52:35.139
What about you?

01:52:35.223 --> 01:52:37.057
Are you blind?

01:52:37.142 --> 01:52:39.685
- Tell me what this is.
- Last night's count.

01:52:39.769 --> 01:52:43.063
You see Dufresne's name there?
I sure do. See? Right there.

01:52:43.148 --> 01:52:45.023
Dufresne.

01:52:46.276 --> 01:52:47.943
He was in his cell at lights out.

01:52:48.027 --> 01:52:51.238
It stands to reason
he'd still be here in the morning.

01:52:52.323 --> 01:52:54.199
I want him found.

01:52:54.284 --> 01:52:56.869
Not tomorrow, not after breakfast.

01:52:56.953 --> 01:52:57.995
Now!

01:52:57.996 --> 01:52:59.496
Yes, sir!

01:53:00.623 --> 01:53:03.209
Let's go, let's go!
Move your butts! Move it!

01:53:06.046 --> 01:53:07.088
Stand.

01:53:08.215 --> 01:53:09.466
Well?

01:53:12.845 --> 01:53:13.970
Well, what?

01:53:14.054 --> 01:53:17.515
I see you two all the time.
You're thick as thieves, you are.

01:53:18.559 --> 01:53:20.185
He must have said something.

01:53:20.269 --> 01:53:22.312
No, sir, Warden.

01:53:22.396 --> 01:53:23.855
Not a word.

01:53:25.858 --> 01:53:27.859
Lord, it's a miracle!

01:53:28.903 --> 01:53:31.362
A man up and vanished like a fart in the wind.

01:53:31.447 --> 01:53:33.198
Nothing left but...

01:53:33.282 --> 01:53:36.201
some damn rocks on a windowsill.

01:53:36.285 --> 01:53:38.036
And that cupcake on the wall.

01:53:38.120 --> 01:53:39.746
Let's ask her.

01:53:39.830 --> 01:53:43.792
Maybe she knows. What say there,
Fuzzy Britches? Feel like talking?

01:53:44.877 --> 01:53:45.960
Ah...

01:53:45.961 --> 01:53:47.420
I guess not.

01:53:47.505 --> 01:53:50.381
Why should she be any different?

01:53:50.466 --> 01:53:52.926
This is a conspiracy.

01:53:53.010 --> 01:53:55.220
That's what this is.

01:53:55.304 --> 01:53:56.846
One big...

01:53:56.931 --> 01:53:59.683
damn conspiracy!

01:53:59.768 --> 01:54:02.436
And everyone's in on it!

01:54:02.521 --> 01:54:03.813
Including her!

01:54:38.473 --> 01:54:40.349
In 1966,

01:54:40.433 --> 01:54:43.102
Andy Dufresne escaped

01:54:43.186 --> 01:54:45.271
from Shawshank Prison.

01:54:46.940 --> 01:54:49.692
All they found of him
was a muddy set of prison clothes,

01:54:49.776 --> 01:54:51.819
a bar of soap

01:54:51.903 --> 01:54:56.282
and an old rock hammer
damn near worn down to the nub.

01:55:00.663 --> 01:55:05.500
I remember thinking it would take a man
600 years to tunnel through the wall with it.

01:55:05.585 --> 01:55:08.295
Old Andy did it in less than 20.

01:55:26.856 --> 01:55:28.940
Oh, Andy loved geology.

01:55:29.984 --> 01:55:33.486
I imagine it appealed to his meticulous nature.

01:55:33.571 --> 01:55:35.864
An Ice Age here,

01:55:35.948 --> 01:55:38.533
a million years of mountain-building there.

01:55:39.577 --> 01:55:41.995
Geology is the study of pressure and time.

01:55:43.205 --> 01:55:45.248
That's all it takes, really.

01:55:45.333 --> 01:55:47.375
Pressure...

01:55:47.460 --> 01:55:49.336
and time.

01:55:49.420 --> 01:55:52.756
That and a big goddamn poster.

01:55:55.969 --> 01:55:57.345
Like I said,

01:55:57.346 --> 01:56:01.140
in prison, a man will do most anything
to keep his mind occupied.

01:56:03.936 --> 01:56:09.106
It turns out Andy's favorite hobby
was toting his wall out into the exercise yard.

01:56:09.191 --> 01:56:11.275
A handful at a time.

01:56:13.111 --> 01:56:15.279
I guess after Tommy was killed,

01:56:15.364 --> 01:56:18.199
Andy decided he'd been here
just about long enough.

01:56:18.283 --> 01:56:20.493
Lickety-split. I want to get home.

01:56:21.787 --> 01:56:23.871
I'm just about finished, sir.

01:56:45.268 --> 01:56:47.353
Three deposits tonight.

01:56:54.529 --> 01:56:56.571
Andy did like he was told.

01:56:57.615 --> 01:57:01.118
Buffed those shoes to a high mirror shine.

01:57:04.706 --> 01:57:06.748
The guard simply didn't notice.

01:57:06.833 --> 01:57:08.875
Neither did I.

01:57:08.960 --> 01:57:13.296
I mean, seriously, how often
do you really look at a man's shoes?

01:59:17.340 --> 01:59:23.512
Andy crawled to freedom through 500 yards
of shit-smelling foulness I can't even imagine.

01:59:24.848 --> 01:59:26.849
Or maybe I just don't want to.

01:59:31.563 --> 01:59:33.772
500 yards.

01:59:34.816 --> 01:59:37.317
That's the length of five football fields.

01:59:38.361 --> 01:59:40.612
Just shy of half a mile.

02:00:35.836 --> 02:00:40.381
The next morning, right about the time
Raquel was spilling her little secret,

02:00:40.466 --> 02:00:43.885
a man nobody ever laid eyes on before

02:00:43.969 --> 02:00:46.388
strode into the Maine National Bank.

02:00:46.473 --> 02:00:48.515
Until that moment,

02:00:48.600 --> 02:00:50.476
he didn't exist,

02:00:50.560 --> 02:00:51.894
except on paper.

02:00:51.978 --> 02:00:53.020
May I help you?

02:00:53.104 --> 02:00:55.147
He had all the proper ID,

02:00:55.232 --> 02:00:58.859
driver's license, birth certificate,
social security card.

02:00:58.944 --> 02:01:02.238
And the signature was a spot-on match.

02:01:02.322 --> 02:01:05.366
I must say, I'm sorry to be losing your business.

02:01:05.450 --> 02:01:07.451
I hope you'll enjoy living abroad.

02:01:07.535 --> 02:01:09.328
Thank you.

02:01:09.412 --> 02:01:11.205
I'm sure I will.

02:01:11.289 --> 02:01:13.415
Here's your cashier's check, sir.

02:01:13.500 --> 02:01:15.542
Will there be anything else?

02:01:15.627 --> 02:01:16.627
Please...

02:01:16.711 --> 02:01:19.797
Would you add this to your outgoing mail?

02:01:19.881 --> 02:01:22.091
I'd be happy to.

02:01:22.175 --> 02:01:24.510
- Good day, sir.
- Good day.

02:01:24.594 --> 02:01:29.390
Mr. Stevens visited nearly a dozen banks
in the Portland area that morning.

02:01:30.558 --> 02:01:37.022
All told, he blew town with better than $370,000
of Warden Norton's money.

02:01:37.107 --> 02:01:39.566
Severance pay for 19 years.

02:01:47.702 --> 02:01:49.995
Good morning, Portland Daily Bugle.

02:02:42.716 --> 02:02:45.718
Byron Hadley?
You have the right to remain silent.

02:02:45.802 --> 02:02:50.431
If you give up the right to remain silent, anything
you say will be held against you in court.

02:02:50.515 --> 02:02:52.391
I wasn't there to see it.

02:02:52.476 --> 02:02:57.355
But I hear Byron Hadley started sobbing
like a little girl when they took him away.

02:03:02.778 --> 02:03:05.571
Norton had no intention of going that quietly.

02:03:21.546 --> 02:03:23.005
Samuel Norton?

02:03:23.090 --> 02:03:26.342
We have a warrant for your arrest. Open up.

02:03:29.221 --> 02:03:30.346
Norton!

02:03:30.430 --> 02:03:32.098
Open the door.

02:03:32.182 --> 02:03:33.933
I'm not sure which key it is.

02:03:36.812 --> 02:03:38.479
Norton!

02:03:43.945 --> 02:03:46.029
Make it easy on yourself, Norton.

02:03:57.333 --> 02:04:00.919
I like to think
the last thing that went through his head,

02:04:01.003 --> 02:04:02.712
other than that bullet,

02:04:02.797 --> 02:04:06.800
was to wonder how the hell
Andy Dufresne ever got the best of him.

02:04:08.469 --> 02:04:09.553
Carter, James...

02:04:09.637 --> 02:04:13.014
Not long after the Warden
deprived us of his company,

02:04:13.099 --> 02:04:15.350
I got a postcard in the mail.

02:04:17.061 --> 02:04:19.479
It was blank but the postmark said...

02:04:19.564 --> 02:04:22.315
Fort Hancock, Texas.

02:04:22.400 --> 02:04:24.443
Fort Hancock.

02:04:24.527 --> 02:04:26.570
Right on the border.

02:04:26.654 --> 02:04:28.697
That's where Andy crossed.

02:04:28.781 --> 02:04:32.659
When I picture him heading south
in his own car with the top down,

02:04:33.703 --> 02:04:35.787
it always makes me laugh.

02:04:37.206 --> 02:04:39.250
Andy Dufresne,

02:04:39.334 --> 02:04:41.711
who crawled through a river of shit

02:04:41.795 --> 02:04:43.880
and came out clean on the other side.

02:04:45.090 --> 02:04:47.133
Andy Dufresne,

02:04:47.217 --> 02:04:49.135
headed for the Pacific.

02:04:51.722 --> 02:04:53.764
Hadley's got him by the toes, right?

02:04:53.849 --> 02:04:58.060
And he says, "I believe this boy's
about to have himself an accident."

02:04:58.145 --> 02:05:01.314
Those of us who knew him best
talk about him often.

02:05:01.398 --> 02:05:03.649
I swear, the stuff he pulled...

02:05:03.734 --> 02:05:06.235
"These friends of mine
could use a couple of beers!"

02:05:06.320 --> 02:05:08.404
- And he got it.
- And he got it!

02:05:09.573 --> 02:05:11.949
Sometimes it makes me sad, though,

02:05:12.034 --> 02:05:14.076
Andy being gone.

02:05:14.161 --> 02:05:18.164
I have to remind myself
that some birds aren't meant to be caged.

02:05:19.249 --> 02:05:21.334
Their feathers are just too bright.

02:05:22.878 --> 02:05:24.921
And when they fly away,

02:05:25.005 --> 02:05:28.925
the part of you that knows
it was a sin to lock them up does rejoice.

02:05:30.677 --> 02:05:32.136
But still...

02:05:32.221 --> 02:05:36.391
the place you live in is that much more drab
and empty that they're gone.

02:05:40.939 --> 02:05:43.190
I guess I just miss my friend.

02:06:07.173 --> 02:06:09.049
Please sit down.

02:06:14.639 --> 02:06:16.765
Ellis Boyd Redding.

02:06:16.849 --> 02:06:20.227
Your files say you've served
40 years of a life sentence.

02:06:20.311 --> 02:06:22.688
Do you feel you've been rehabilitated?

02:06:24.816 --> 02:06:26.900
Rehabilitated?

02:06:28.444 --> 02:06:30.529
Well, now, let me see.

02:06:31.573 --> 02:06:33.907
You know, I don't have any idea
what that means.

02:06:35.703 --> 02:06:38.246
Well, it means you're ready to rejoin society...

02:06:38.330 --> 02:06:40.873
I know what you think it means, sonny.

02:06:43.252 --> 02:06:45.336
To me, it's just a made-up word.

02:06:46.380 --> 02:06:48.631
A politician's word so that...

02:06:48.716 --> 02:06:54.220
young fellas like yourself
can wear a suit and a tie and have a job.

02:06:56.640 --> 02:06:58.725
What do you really want to know?

02:06:59.893 --> 02:07:01.811
Am I sorry for what I did?

02:07:01.895 --> 02:07:03.605
Well, are you?

02:07:05.232 --> 02:07:07.817
There's not a day goes by I don't feel regret.

02:07:09.403 --> 02:07:12.530
Not because I'm in here
or because you think I should.

02:07:16.327 --> 02:07:18.411
I look back on the way I was then.

02:07:20.998 --> 02:07:23.041
A young...

02:07:23.125 --> 02:07:26.210
stupid kid who committed that terrible crime.

02:07:30.049 --> 02:07:32.133
I wanna talk to him.

02:07:33.511 --> 02:07:35.679
I wanna try and talk some sense to him,

02:07:36.723 --> 02:07:38.807
tell him the way things are.

02:07:40.977 --> 02:07:43.062
But I can't.

02:07:44.272 --> 02:07:46.357
That kid's long gone.

02:07:47.651 --> 02:07:49.735
This old man is all that's left.

02:07:51.863 --> 02:07:53.364
I gotta live with that.

02:07:54.699 --> 02:07:56.492
Rehabilitated?

02:07:56.576 --> 02:07:58.577
It's just a bullshit word.

02:07:58.662 --> 02:08:04.583
So you go on and stamp your form, sonny,
and stop wasting my time.

02:08:05.669 --> 02:08:07.711
Because to tell you the truth,

02:08:07.796 --> 02:08:10.297
I don't give a shit.

02:09:36.511 --> 02:09:38.596
Here you go, miss.

02:09:40.599 --> 02:09:42.057
Rest room break, boss?

02:09:48.106 --> 02:09:52.401
You don't need to ask me every time you need
to go take a piss. Just go. Understand?

02:09:53.612 --> 02:09:55.279
Yes, sir.

02:10:05.332 --> 02:10:08.375
40 years
I've been asking permission to piss.

02:10:09.377 --> 02:10:11.587
I can't squeeze a drop without say-so.

02:10:15.717 --> 02:10:17.802
There's a harsh truth to face.

02:10:19.763 --> 02:10:22.097
No way I'm gonna make it on the outside.

02:10:30.316 --> 02:10:33.777
All I do any more
is think of ways to break my parole...

02:10:34.821 --> 02:10:36.905
..so maybe they'd send me back.

02:10:42.411 --> 02:10:44.496
A terrible thing to live in fear.

02:10:45.873 --> 02:10:49.251
Brooks Hatlen knew it, knew it all too well.

02:10:51.420 --> 02:10:54.214
All I want is to be back
where things make sense,

02:10:55.258 --> 02:10:57.759
where I won't have to be afraid all the time.

02:11:00.638 --> 02:11:02.722
Only one thing stops me.

02:11:03.766 --> 02:11:05.851
A promise I made to Andy.

02:11:26.582 --> 02:11:28.666
Here it is.

02:11:38.468 --> 02:11:40.553
Much obliged, sir.

02:15:19.360 --> 02:15:20.652
Dear Red,

02:15:20.736 --> 02:15:23.196
if you're reading this, you've gotten out.

02:15:23.280 --> 02:15:27.534
And if you've come this far,
maybe you're willing to come a little further.

02:15:27.618 --> 02:15:30.203
You remember the name of the town, don't you?

02:15:32.498 --> 02:15:34.582
Zihuatanejo.

02:15:35.626 --> 02:15:36.835
I could use a good man

02:15:36.919 --> 02:15:38.962
to help me get my project on wheels.

02:15:39.046 --> 02:15:41.172
I'll keep an eye out for you

02:15:41.257 --> 02:15:43.299
and the chessboard ready.

02:15:44.343 --> 02:15:45.718
Remember, Red,

02:15:45.803 --> 02:15:47.846
hope is a good thing.

02:15:47.930 --> 02:15:49.973
Maybe the best of things.

02:15:50.057 --> 02:15:52.142
And no good thing ever dies.

02:15:53.185 --> 02:15:55.645
I will be hoping that this letter finds you

02:15:55.729 --> 02:15:57.772
and finds you well.

02:15:57.857 --> 02:16:00.358
Your friend, Andy.

02:16:34.936 --> 02:16:38.814
Get busy living or get busy dying.

02:16:41.318 --> 02:16:43.402
That's goddamn right.

02:16:48.909 --> 02:16:51.035
For the second time in my life,

02:16:51.119 --> 02:16:53.204
I'm guilty of committing a crime.

02:16:54.873 --> 02:16:56.957
Parole violation.

02:16:56.958 --> 02:17:00.669
Of course, I doubt they'll toss up
any roadblocks for that.

02:17:01.922 --> 02:17:03.964
Not for an old crook like me.

02:17:04.049 --> 02:17:06.133
Fort Hancock, Texas, please.

02:17:09.846 --> 02:17:13.975
I find I'm so excited I can barely sit still
or hold a thought in my head.

02:17:15.019 --> 02:17:18.021
I think it's the excitement
only a free man can feel.

02:17:18.105 --> 02:17:20.815
A free man at the start of a long journey

02:17:20.900 --> 02:17:23.818
whose conclusion is uncertain.

02:17:26.697 --> 02:17:28.865
I hope I can make it across the border.

02:17:30.743 --> 02:17:33.536
I hope to see my friend and shake his hand.

02:17:35.915 --> 02:17:39.125
I hope the Pacific is as blue
as it has been in my dreams.

02:17:41.879 --> 02:17:43.755
I hope.
